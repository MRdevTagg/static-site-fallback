    <p>It is traditionally believed that peer review is the backbone of anacademicjournal and scientific communication, ensuringhigh quality and trust in the published materials. However, peer review only became an institutionalized practice in the second half of the 20th century, although the first scientific journals appeared three centuries earlier.

  Introduction: /* html */ `
    <p>International journals often require additional assessment of the level of English. However, this is not a comprehensive list, and the list of criteria to be evaluated may vary from journal to journal. Nevertheless, as early as the beginning of the 21st century, it was argued that the system of peer review is "broken" (McCook, 2006). The main problem noted by McCook is the increasing number of manuscripts and the burden on reviewers. However, this is just the tip of the iceberg. Allen et al. (2022) highlighted the issue of the "black box": the anonymity of traditional peer review should maintain honesty and ethical norms, but it also can stifle discussion, generate biases, and reduce the overall effectiveness of peer review. In fact, the function of being the "supreme judge" in deciding what is "good" and "bad" science is taken on by peer review, defending the dominant scientific paradigm and stifling the emergence of new ideas that always arise on the periphery. However, as academician L.I. Abalkin once remarked, "no one has the right to usurp the truth" (Sukharev, 2020, p. 44). If we do not change our approach, science will either stagnate or transition into other forms of communication. Moreover, the current system has become an "exploitation machine": publishers benefit in most cases, while reviewers work voluntarily. There is a point of view that peer review is included in the implicit contract of the researcher. Nevertheless, given that most of the research and, accordingly, research positions are funded from public funds, we nonetheless observe a tendency to "reap where they did not sow." R. Smith (2006) strongly criticized the review while at the same time comparing it to democracy: "a system full of problems but the least worst we have" (p. 178). Is this really the case? And can we talk about peer review as a uniform concept, given the variety of existing models? This study aims to synthesize the key characteristics, practices, and outcomes of traditional and innovative peer review models in scholarly publishing. In the following section, we will attempt to demonstrate how the traditional peer review model has developed and how it has come to the current crisis. Furthermore, we will discuss possible ways to overcome the crisis and how the institution of peer review is evolving in the context of global changes in scientific publishing. A separate section discusses modular publishing, which incorporates various innovations in the publishing process, and in particular, the review process. The scope of this piece is limited to peer review in the context of the publication of scientific articles, but its findings are quite applicable to the publication of books or conference proceedings. At the same time, review for other purposes, e.g., evaluation of grant applications, is a topic for a separate discussion</p>
    `,
  'Evolution and crisis of peer review': /* html */ `
    <p>The practice of prepublication peer review as we understand it today emerged much later than the founding of first academic journals. E.g., Journal des Sçavans, which was published from 1665 and is considered the first academic journal, printed a warning on the first page “We aim to report the ideas of others without guaranteeing them” (Rennie, 1999, p. 2).</p>

<p>However, Kronick (1990) argued that peer review as feedback from peers, in the broad sense of the word, existed as soon as scientists began to exchange research results. Peer review emerged in the form of letters, reviews, and comments that appeared after publication (usually in the case of books).</p>

<p>A narrower understanding of peer review, as an evaluation of scientific work by peers before publication (prereview), first appeared in 1731 in the first issue of Medical Essays and Observations, published by the Royal Society of Edinburgh.</p>
<p>In 1752, the Royal Society of
London took responsibility for publication of Philosophical Transactions and established the
"Committee on Papers." The review process was conducted by the members of the Royal Society
with the highest expertise in the topics under consideration. In the late 1890s, the printed peer
review report was introduced as a supplement to invitation letter (Fyfe, 2019).
Despite the emergence of pre-publication peer review in the 18th century, it remained a noninstitutionalized practice for a long time. In many journals, peer review was not conducted, and
the decision on publication was mainly made by the editor. From this point of view, academic
journals of the 17th-19th centuries more closely resembled modern newspapers or popular
magazines. Peer review became a standard practice only after World War II (Chapelle, 2014).
E.g., the well-known British medical journal The Lancet introduced the practice of obligatory
peer review in 1976. The rapidly increasing flow of manuscripts played a key role in the
institutionalization of peer review, prompting journals to conduct an "entry filtration" of content.
Thus, by the second half of the 20th century, the traditional model of pre-publication peer review
had been definitively established (Fig. 1).</p>
${renderImage(
  9,
  1,
  'Figure 1: Evolution of peer review models in scientific communication',
)}
<p>The institutionalization of peer review is manifested in the development of ethical principles
which have been adopted by the majority of the academic community. One of the most wellknown documents, Ethical Guidelines for Peer Reviewers (2013), was developed by the
Committee on Publication Ethics (COPE). This document contains basic principles for
reviewers, which have become common practice in the workflow of academic publishers
worldwide. Furthermore, most academic journals have a section on their websites that describes
the peer review policy applied by the journal.
Despite the progress in editorial policies, which we observe in the formalization of requirements
for the peer review process, opinions have been expressed since the end of the 20th century
about a crisis in peer review as an institution. In the Introduction, we have already mentioned</p>
<p>
some of the existing issues, and now we will consider them in more detail. In particular, the
following issues can be highlighted:
</p>
${generateOrderedList([
  'The rapidly growing volume of manuscripts, coupled with an increasing workload for researchers and faculty, leads to a shortage of reviewers. The primary reason for declining to review is the simple lack of time (Tite & Schroter, 2007; Willis, 2016). This issue causes extension of review periods and frustration of authors.',
  'The shortage of reviewers forces journals to expand their search. Sometimes, this results in manuscripts being reviewed by researchers who do not possess sufficient expertise in the subject. Several studies have noted a low level of consensus among reviewers (Bornmann, 2011), leading some research to refer to peer review as a “game of chance” (Neff & Olden, 2006). The low level of peer review also contributes to the crisis of reproducibility in scientific research (Stoddart, 2016). Although this crisis is due to a multitude of factors, the peer review system bears a significant responsibility for it.',
  "The current peer review system exacerbates inequality in science. Bias often hides behind anonymity, creating a 'black box' problem. Despite constant calls for equality and inclusivity in science (COPE, 2021), a few groups still dominate scientific periodicals, such as male authors from the United States and the United Kingdom. O. M. Smith et al. (2023) analyzed 300,000 manuscripts in biological sciences and concluded that authors from historically excluded communities face worse outcomes in peer review, and journal efforts to eliminate reviewer bias have not yet been successful. Nevertheless, we must recognize the debatable nature of this issue. For instance, Squazzoni et al. (2021) found no systematic bias against manuscripts submitted by women in the peer review process, with some evidence of favorable treatment for women in certain fields. Walker et al. (2015) found that the gender of the author and the characteristics of the author's institution had a significant impact on the review outcomes. However, it is impossible to determine whether this was due to objective differences in scientific merit or to biases.",
  'Continuing from point 3, peer review is also often seen to protect widely accepted approaches and concepts to the detriment of novelty. Peer review can inadvertently stifle innovation and radical new ideas (Steinhauser et al., 2012). The process tends to favor established concepts and discourage the publication of unusual or disparate discoveries (Hess, 1975). As a result, it may limit opportunities for game-changing scientific discoveries (Braben & Dowler, 2017). The neoclassical school in economics may be seen as an example of this phenomenon. The crisis of the neoclassical school began in the early 21st century (Williams & McNeill, 2005), partly due to the inability to explain the global financial crisis of 2008 (Keen, 2015). However, a paradigm shift has still not occurred - the neoclassical school still occupies a central position in the economic science (and the policies of many countries).',
  'Finally, the current form of peer review is simply inefficient. On the one hand, long peer review slows down the process of disseminating new knowledge (see point 1), and on the other hand, often a large number of reviews are required for a single article. The reason for this is that when authors receive a rejection from one journal, they often submit the same article to another journal, starting the entire process anew. Aczel et al. (2021) found that in 2021, reviewers worldwide spent over 100 million hours, equivalent to more than 15,000 years. If we evaluate this time in terms of money, the cost for reviewers in the USA amounted to over $1.5 billion, in China over $600 million, and in the UK around $400 million. Therefore, peer review is a quite costly activity, and currently, doubts arise regarding the efficiency of its utilization.',
])}
    `,
  'Innovations in peer review': /* html */ `
    <p>We have demonstrated the current crisis of the traditional peer review model. In this regard, the
question arises about the possible ways to overcome the crisis. Recently, a lot of literature has
been published on innovations in the field of peer review (see reviews by Kaltenbrunner et al.,
2022; Woods et al., 2022). Waltman et al. (2023) classified innovations in peer review into four
"schools of thought." We propose adding a parameter to this typology that will characterize
innovations relative to the currently dominant publication workflow (incremental / radical). It
enables creation of a two-factor matrix (Table 1).</p>
${renderImage(
  9,
  2,
  'Source: compiled by the author based on Waltman et al. (2023).',
)}
<p>We should acknowledge that the above-mentioned innovations can simultaneously be placed in different groups. For example, registered reports not only aim to improve the quality of peer review, but also aim to contribute to its efficiency. Now, let's consider each of the directions in detail.</p>
<h4>3.1. Quality and reproducibility</h4>
<p>Training of reviewers through seminars and online courses is part of the strategies of many
publishers3
. At the same time, we have not been able to find statistical data or research to assess
the effectiveness of such training. Software for automatic evaluation of scientific papers based on artificial intelligence (AI) has emerged relatively recently (StatReviewer4
, UNSILO5
)
6
. We can
also allocate here the package for checking statistical analysis statcheck7
. Currently, these are just
auxiliary tools that cannot replace human labor (Baker, 2015; Heaven, 2018), but considering the
pace of development of generative AI technologies, these tools have a great future. The
increasing role of data in scientific research has led some publishers to recognize the need for
review of datasets (e.g., PLOS (A Reviewer’s Quick Guide to Assessing Open Datasets, n.d.).
This also applies to review of code in research papers8
.
We have identified registered reports as a radical innovation because it changes the view of the
publication workflow and the object of peer review (Registered Reports: Peer Review before
Results Are Known to Align Scientific Values and Practices., n.d.). Registered reports are a
special type of empirical publication that reflects a hypothetico-deductive approach in science
(Fig. 2). Studies are registered and undergo the first stage of review at the early stages of
research process. In this case, the research question and methodological approach are evaluated
directly. If the peer review results are positive, the study is provisionally accepted for
publication, after which data collection, analysis, and interpretation are carried out. These steps
are followed by the second stage of peer review, during which the conducted study is compared
to the previously registered methodological approach (study protocol).</p>
${renderImage(
  9,
  3,
  'Figure 2: Registered reports - publication workflow (Model 2).',
)}
<p>It should be noted that most initiatives aimed at improving the quality of peer review
simultaneously increase the costs.</p>

<h4>3.2. Democracy and transparency</h4>
<p>The approach to peer review in which only the rigor and soundness of the methodology are
reviewed (as applied, for example, in PLOS ONE and Scientific Reports) somewhat resembles
registered reports, with the difference that the review is conducted in a single stage. This
preserves the traditional publication workflow but changes the object of review. The key
motivation in this case is that the broader academic community will be better able to assess the
significance and contribution of the study than just editor and peer reviewers (Spezi et al., 2017).
The next level of "openness" is open peer review, where the reviews are available to readers
along with the published article (biomedical journals such as BMJ and BMC were pioneers in adopting this innovation). Wolfram et al. (2020) identified 617 journals that published at least
one article with open identities or open peer review reports as of 2019. Though a steady growth
of open peer review adoption has been observed recently, publishers have implemented this
practice in different ways, resulting in different levels of transparency. Another issue is that in the
case of rejection, only authors see the reviews.
Post-publication review, which is most often implemented in the form of open review of
preprints, can be considered the most transparent approach. This approach radically changes the
essence of peer review. It is no longer a tool for deciding whether to publish a paper or not, but
rather a platform for discussion. Publication is no longer the final stage of work; it becomes its
starting point. Platforms such as eLife9
, Peer Community in10, and F1000Research11 use a model
called “Publish-Review-Curate” (PRC). The MetaROR project using this model of review is
expected to launch this year (Kaltenbrunner et al., 2023). The PRC model is shown in Fig. 3. It is
important to note that for each specific case it will be slightly different. E.g., in the case of
MetaROR, the publication is initially hosted on preprint servers such as arXiv, MetaArXiv,
SocArXiv, bioRxiv, or OSF Preprints.</p>
${renderImage(9, 4)}
${renderImage(
  9,
  5,
  'Figure 3: “Publish-Review-Curate” model (Model 3). Model 3a involves uploading the manuscript directly to a platform (e.g., F1000Research). Model 3b, on the other hand, involves initially posting a preprint on a preprint server followed by peer review on a peer review platform (e.g., eLife and Peer Community in).',
)}
<p>In addition to the projects mentioned, there are other platforms, for example, PREreview12
,
which departs even more radically from the traditional review format due to the decentralized
structure of work.</p>

<h4>3.3. Equity and inclusion</h4>
<p>
    The principles of equity and inclusion, as well as the inappropriateness of biases of different origins (geographic, gender, ethnicity), are reflected in numerous recommendations (e.g., COPE, 2021; Royal Society of Chemistry, 2020) and policies of most major academic publishers. However, as mentioned above, the results of implementing these policies are still far from successful, and perhaps these processes require more time. Double-blind peer review is intended to protect the identity of the author and thereby prevent bias in the review. This practice has been used for quite a time in the social sciences and humanities (Horbach & Halffman, 2020; Karhulahti & Backe, 2021). However, anonymity is very conditional - there are still many “keys” left in the manuscript, by which one can determine, if not the identity of the author, then his country, research group, or affiliated organization. On the other hand, the reviewer's identity is much more securely protected. This issue is especially evident in localized communities: in Russia we often encounter deliberately positive or deliberately negative reviews (Sukharev, 2020). The same is true in specialized fields where reviewers may have conflicts of interest (Rühli et al., 2009). Thus, “closeness” is not a good way to address biases.
</p>

<h4>3.4. Efficiency and incentives</h4>
<p>
    Any work requires not only an internal motive, but also external incentives. Peer review, as one of the key activities in science, requires appropriate recognition. This practice is implemented in the form of certificates of recognition from academic publishers, as well as records reflected in the profiles of researchers on various platforms (Web of Science, ORCID). Unfortunately, at the moment, peer review is practically not taken into account in the systems of reward and recognition of researchers and faculty adopted at universities and at the national level. Note that open review increases the visibility of reviewers' work, which should potentially affect recognition. As mentioned, traditional peer review faces efficiency issues. This is largely due to the fact that the same article, having been rejected in one journal, is submitted to another, where peer review process begins from scratch. One way to solve this problem would be to transfer reviews between journals, also known as “portable peer review.” At the moment, this model is used by large publishing houses (manuscript transfer to another journal of the same publishing house). There are also consortia of journals, such as the Neuroscience Peer Review Consortium (Saper et al., 2009), as well as Manuscript Exchange Common Approach (MECA), an initiative that supports the exchange of manuscripts and reviews between journals and platforms, including preprint servers (NISO RP-30-2023, Manuscript Exchange Common Approach (MECA) (Version 2.0.1), 2023). Although review exchange reduces peer review costs, it doesn’t significantly change the editorial workflow; thus, it is simply an add-on to Model 1 (the traditional model). The idea of exchanging reviews has evolved into journal-independent peer review. The Reviewer Commons, a consortium of 23 life sciences journals, brought this idea into practice. A manuscript is published on a preprint server and undergoes independent review, following which the author can revise the paper and submit it to one of the consortium members. Improving the quality of peer review is achieved by ensuring that reviewers focus on the manuscript itself,
rather than the question whether it fits a particular journal. However, we believe that journalindependent peer review is a special case of Model 3 (“Publish-Review-Curate”).
</p>
    `,
  'Modular Publishing': /* html */ `
    <p>Strictly speaking, modular publishing is primarily an innovative approach for the publishing
workflow in general rather than specifically for peer review. This approach allows for a more
detailed and in-depth exploration of the research process. Besides, modular publishing, which is
a type of deconstructed publication14, combines different models of peer review. This is why we
have placed this innovation in a separate category. Nevertheless, modular publications can
potentially have a significant impact on peer review practices. Modular publication platforms are
like preprint servers, except that they publish not an entire manuscript, but individual significant
fragments of it (hypotheses, methodologies, datasets, program code, etc.). These items
essentially represent the different stages of a research process. This approach could potentially
allow for feedback on each stage completed.
The most well-known initiatives at the moment are ResearchEquals15 and Octopus16
.
ResearchEquals allows to upload 37 research modules, one of which is "Other". There is a
separate "Review" item. The research modules can be uploaded in any order. Octopus assumes
uploading eight research elements in a certain sequence (one of which is peer review), which is
more consistent with empirical research. Thus, both platforms offer open post-publication
review. Octopus assumes the possibility of revising previously published modules; in
ResearchEquals, there is no possibility of versioning. Based on this, we can conclude that the
review in the modular publishing resembles Model 3, while the idea itself may be seen as an
extension of Model 2. Currently, some of the features are not being implemented due to the
technical limitations of the platforms.
A related initiative is currently being developed by the Centre for Open Science, which plans to
launch a new approach to scientific communication called Lifecycle Journals (Lifecycle
Journals, n.d.). These journals will combine the idea of modular publishing with features such as
post-publication peer review and registered reports. Although the initiative is currently in the
planning stage, it seems promising.</p>
    `,
  'Discussion and Conclusion': /* html */ `
    <p>In the previous sections, we briefly examined the evolution of the peer review and its current
crisis in relation to scientific communication. Next, we explored the main innovations in peer
review, which can be classified according to the course of proposed changes and the degree of
influence on the editorial workflow, incremental and radical. As a result, we can conclude that, at
present, there are three major models of peer review and related editorial workflow:</p>
${generateUnorderedList([
  'Model 1: traditional model (pre-publication peer review),',
  'Model 2: registered reports,',
  'Model 3: “Publish-Review-Curate” (post-publication review).',
])}
<p>Table 2 presents comparative characteristics of these models.</p>
<p>Table 2 – Comparative analysis of the three review models in terms of editorial workflow</p>
${renderImage(9, 6)}
<p>We can also compare the three models in terms of the main functions of science communication</p>
<>(Table 3). The four main functions of scientific communication are registration, dissemination,
certification and archiving (Roosendaal & Geurts, 1997; Taubert, 2017).</p>
<p>Table 3 - Comparative analysis of the three models of review in terms of functions of scientific communication</p>
${renderImage(9, 7)}
${renderImage(9, 8, '* Preprint is optional for Models 1 and 2.')}
<p>Thus, in Model 3, all functions of scientific communication are implemented most quickly and
transparently. The additional costs arising from the independent assessment of information based
on open reviews are more than compensated by the emerging opportunities for scientific
pluralism. Model 3 corresponds to the vision of the International Science Council (ISC) on
"more efficient and effective modes of peer review that are inspired by open norms"
(International Science Council, 2023, p. 12).
The traditional publication process model with a “black box” peer review inside is increasingly
proving its inadequacy. Registered reports are promising but are exclusively focused on
empirical research. The "Publish-Review-Curate" model is universal that we expect to be the
future of scientific publishing. The transition will not happen today or tomorrow, but in the next
5-10 years, the number of projects such as eLife, F1000Research, Peer Community in, or
MetaROR will rapidly increase. We should also note that the constructive elements of Model 3
can be transferred to Model 2 (in terms of openness of the review process, especially on the first
stage).</p>
<p>At the same time, we must recognize the complexity of institutional change. The possibilities for
normative regulation here are quite limited - much depends on the traditions embedded in the
academic community, and it will take a lot of time to change them. Openness is a complex
process that requires three conditions:</p>
${generateOrderedList([
  'Group of people willing to take responsibility for the quality of scientific communication in this academic community,',
  'Authors and reviewers willing to accept this practice,',
  'Appropriate infrastructure.',
])}
<p>Avissar-Whiting et al. (2024) provided a useful toolbox of recommendations for all parties
potentially involved in the preprint review process.
A significant development was the announcement by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation of its
new Open Access Policy (Brembs & Drury, 2024). The foundation has discontinued Article
Processing Charges (APCs) and introduced a mandatory requirement for grantees to publish
preprints. In addition, the foundation is supporting the development of an open infrastructure for
preprinting. Later, it was announced that the foundation would be launching a new verified
preprint platform in collaboration with F1000Research (“Gates Foundation Collaborates with
F1000 to Launch Verified Preprint Platform,” 2024). This is another step towards normalizing
post-publication reviews, while the publication of preprints is increasingly becoming the norm
(Drury, 2022).
Post-publication review is a return to the roots of scientific communication. This model will
allow all actors involved to take greater responsibility for their work, authors for their articles,
reviewers for their assessments, and editors for supporting the process of scientific
communication. This is the atmosphere of scientific discussion that we need very much.
However, it is important to acknowledge that current peer review practices vary significantly
across fields. While pre-publication peer review is prevalent in almost all fields, there are
numerous variations in terms of its openness or anonymity. Additionally, while some fields have
successfully incorporated innovations, others continue to resist. E.g., preprint publishing has
been an essential form of publication in physics since 1990s (Ginsparg, 2011), and open peer
review was introduced in biomedical journals prior to other domains (e.g., BMJ and BMC). At
the same time, the social sciences and humanities (SSH), in terms of their peer review and
publication process, remain relatively closed (Ross-Hellauer & Horbach, 2024).
We should also acknowledge that the list of innovations in peer review presented in this paper is
not comprehensive. For instance, we could mention ranking papers instead of reviewing them or
bidding for papers (Birukou et al., 2011). However, these initiatives are not yet widely adopted,
so they do not significantly affect the publishing landscape</p>

                    The work ‘Evolution of Peer Review in Scientific Communication’ provides a consise and radable summary of the historical role of peer review in modern science. The paper categorises the peer review practices into three models: (1) traditional pre-publication peer review; (2) registered reports; (3) post-publication peer review. The author compares the three models and draws the conclusion that the “third model offers the best way to implement the main funtion of scientific communication”. 

I would contest this conclusion. In my eyes the three models serve different aims - with more or less drawbacks. For example, although Model 3 is less chance to insert bias to the readers, it also weakens the filtering function of the review system. Let’s just think about the dangers of machine-generated articles, paper-mills, p-hacked research reports and so on. Although the editors does some pre-screening for the submissions, in a world with only Model 3 peer review the literature could easily get loaded with even more ‘garbage’ than in a model where additional peers help the screening. 

Compared to registered reports other aspects can come to focus that Model 3 cannot cover. It’s the efficiency of researchers’ work. In the care of registered reports, Stage 1 review can still help researchers to modify or improve their research design or data collection method. Empirical work can be costly and time-consuming and post-publication review can only say that “you should have done it differently then it would make sense” . 

Finally, the author puts openness as a strength of Model 3. In my eyes, openness is a separate question. All models can work very openly and transparently in the right circumstances. This dimension is not an inherent part of the models. 

In conclusion, I would not make verdict over the models, instead emphasise the different functions they can play in scientific communication.

A minor comment: I found that a number of statements lack references in the Introduction. I would have found them useful for statements such as “There is a point of view that peer review is included in the implicit contract of the researcher.”

          review: splitTextIntoParagraphs(`
In "Evolution of Peer Review in Scientific Communication", Kochetkov provides a point-of-view discussion of the current state of play of peer review for scientific literature, focussing on the major models in contemporary use and recent innovations in reform. In particular, they present a typology of three main forms of peer review: traditional pre-

publication review; registered reports; and post-publication review, their preferred model. The main contribution it could make would be to help consolidate typologies and terminologies, to consolidate major lines of argument and to present some useful visualisations of these. On the other hand, the overall discussion is not strongly original in character.

The major strength of this article is that the discussion is well-informed by contemporary developments in peer-review reform. The typology presented is modest and, for that, readily comprehensible and intuitive. This is to some extent a weakness as well as a strength; a typology that is too straightforward may not be useful enough. As suggested at the end it might be worth considering how to complexify the typology at least at subordinate levels without sacrificing this strength. The diagrams of workflows are particularly clear.

The primary weakness of this article is that it presents itself as an 'analysis' from which they 'conclude' certain results such as their typology, when this appears clearly to be an opinion piece. In my view, this results in a false claim of objectivity which detracts from what would otherwise be an interesting and informative, albeit subjective, discussion, and thus fails to discuss the limitations of this approach. A secondary weakness is that the discussion is not well structured and there are some imprecisions of expression that have the potential to confuse, at least at first.

This primary weakness is manifested in several ways. The evidence and reasoning for claims made is patchy or absent. One instance of the former is the discussion of bias in peer review. There are a multitude of studies of such bias and indeed quite a few meta-analyses of these studies. A systematic search could have been done here but there is no attempt to discuss the totality of this literature. Instead, only a few specific studies are cited. Why are these ones chosen? We have no idea. To this extent I am not convinced that the references used here are the most appropriate. Instances of the latter are the claim that "The most well-known initiatives at the moment are ResearchEquals and Octopus" for which no evidence is provided, the claim that " we believe that journal-independent peer review is a special case of Model 3" for which no further argument is provided, and the claim that "the function of being the "supreme judge" in deciding what is "good" and "bad" science is taken on by peer review" for which neither is provided.

A particular example of this weakness, which is perhaps of marginal importance to the overall paper but of strong interest to this reviewer is the rather odd engagement with history within the paper. It is titled "Evolution of Peer Review" but is really focussed on the contemporary state-of-play. Section 2 starts with a short history of peer review in scientific publishing, but that seems intended only to establish what is described as the 'traditional' model of peer review. Given that that short history had just shown how peer review had been continually changing in character over centuries - and indeed Kochetkov goes on to describe further changes - it is a little difficult to work out what 'traditional' might mean here; what was 'traditional' in 2010 was not the same as what was 'traditional' in 1970. It is not clear how seriously this history is being taken. Kochetkov has earlier written that "as early as the beginning of the 21st century, it was argued that the system of peer review is 'broken'" but of course criticisms - including fundamental criticisms - of peer review are much older than this. Overall, this use of history seems designed to privilege the experience of a particular moment in time, that coincides with the start of the metascience reform movement.

Section 2 also demonstrates some of the second weakness described, a rather loose structure. Having moved from a discussion of the history of peer review to detail the first model, 'traditional' peer review, it then also goes on to describe the problems of this model. This part of the paper is one of the best - and best -evidenced. Given the importance of it to the main thrust of the discussion it should probably have been given more space as a Section all on its own.

Another example is Section 4 on Modular Publishing, in which Kochetkov notes "Strictly speaking, modular publishing is primarily an innovative approach for the publishing workflow in general rather than specifically for peer review." Kochetkov says "This is why we have placed this innovation in a separate category" but if it is not an innovation in peer review, the bigger question is 'Why was it included in this article at all?'.

One example of the imprecisions of language is as follows. The author also shifts between the terms 'scientific communication' and 'science communication' but, at least in many contexts familiar to this reviewer, these are not the same things, the former denoting science-internal dissemination of results through publication (which the author considers), conferences and the like (which the author specifically excludes) while the latter denotes the science-external public dissemination of scientific findings to non-technical audiences, which is entirely out of scope for this article.

A final note is that Section 3, while an interesting discussion, seems largely derivative from a typology of Waltman, with the addition of a consideration of whether a reform is 'radical' or 'incremental', based on how 'disruptive' the reform is. Given that this is inherently a subjective decision, I wonder if it might not have been more informative to consider 'disruptiveness' on a scale and plot it accordingly. This would allow for some range to be imagined for each reform as well; surely reforms might be more or less disruptive depending on how they are implemented. Given that each reform is considered against each model, it is somewhat surprising that this is not presented in a tabular or graphical form.

Beyond the specific suggestions in the preceding paragraphs, my suggestions to improve this article are as follows:

1. Reconceptualize this as an opinion piece. Where systematic evidence can be drawn upon to make points, use that, but don't be afraid to just present a discussion from what is clearly a well-informed author.

2. Reconsider the focus on history and 'evolution' if the point is about the current state of play and evaluation of reforms (much as I would always want to see more studies on the history and evolution of peer review).

3. Consider ways in which the typology might be expanded, even if at subordinate level.

I have no competing interests in the compilation of this review, although I do have specific interests as noted above.

          review: splitTextIntoParagraphs(`
          Overall thoughts: This is an interesting history piece regarding peer review and the development of review over time. Given the author’s conflict of interest and association with the Centre developing MetaROR, I think that this paper might be a better fit for an information page or introduction to the journal and rationale for the creation of MetaROR, rather than being billed as an independent article. Alternatively, more thorough information about advantages to pre-publication review or more downsides/challenges to post-publication review might make the article seem less affiliated. I appreciate seeing the history and current efforts to change peer review, though I am not comfortable broadly encouraging use of these new approaches based on this article alone.

 

Page 3: It’s hard to get a feel for the timeline given the dates that are described. We have peer review becoming standard after WWII (after 1945), definitively established by the second half of the century, an example of obligatory peer review starting in 1976, and in crisis by the end of the 20th century. I would consider adding examples that better support this timeline – did it become more common in specific journals before 1976? Was the crisis by the end of the 20th century something that happened over time or something that was already intrinsic to the institution? It doesn’t seem like enough time to get established and then enter crisis, but more details/examples could help make the timeline clear. 

Consider discussing the benefits of the traditional model of peer review.

Table 1 – Most of these are self-explanatory to me as a reader, but not all. I don’t know what a registered report refers to, and it stands to reason that not all of these innovations are familiar to all readers. You do go through each of these sections, but that’s not clear when I initially look at the table. Consider having a more informative caption. Additionally, the left column is “Course of changes” here but “Directions” in text. I’d pick one and go with it for consistency.

3.2: Considering mentioning your conflict of interest here where MetaROR is mentioned.

With some of these methods, there’s the ability to also submit to a regular journal. Going to a regular journal presumably would instigate a whole new round of review, which may or may not contradict the previous round of post-publication review and would increase the length of time to publication by going through both types. If someone has a goal to publish in a journal, what benefit would they get by going through the post-publication review first, given this extra time?

There’s a section talking about institutional change (page 14). It mentions that openness requires three conditions – people taking responsibility for scientific communication, authors and reviewers, and infrastructure. I would consider adding some discussion of readers and evaluators. Readers have to be willing to accept these papers as reliable, trustworthy, and respectable to read and use the information in them. Evaluators such as tenure committees and potential employers would need to consider papers submitted through these approaches as evidence of scientific scholarship for the effort to be worthwhile for scientists.

Based on this overview, which seems somewhat skewed towards the merits of these methods (conflict of interest, limited perspective on downsides to new methods/upsides to old methods), I am not quite ready to accept this effort as equivalent of a regular journal and pre-publication peer review process. I look forward to learning more about the approach and seeing this review method in action and as it develops.

          <p class="paragraph">The principal findings to my mind, well described in the abstract, include the observations that (1) researchers’ strongest preference was for journal impact factor and (2) that they were prepared to remove results from their papers if that would allow publication in a higher impact factor journal.

The second is much more striking – and concerning for the research community (and its funders). This is the first time I have seen evidence for such a trade-off.</p>
          <p class="paragraph">&nbsp;</p>
          <p class="paragraph">Overall, the manuscript is very clearly written. I have no major issues with the methods or results. However, I think but some minor revisions would enhance the clarity and utility of the paper.
          </p>
          <p class="paragraph">&nbsp;</p>
          <p class="paragraph">First, although it is made clear in Table 1 that the researchers included in the study are all from the medical and clinical sciences, this is not apparent from the title or the abstract. I think both should be modified to reflect the nature of the sample. In my experience researchers in these fields are among those who feel most intensely the pressure to publish in high IF journals. The authors may want also to reflect in a revised manuscript how well their findings may transfer to other disciplines.</p>
          <p class="paragraph">&nbsp;</p>
          <p class="paragraph">Second, in several places I felt the discussion of the results could be enriched by reference to papers in the recent literature that are missing from the bibliography. These include (1) Muller and De Rijcke’s 2017 paper on Thinking with Indicators, which discusses how the pressure of metrics impacts the conduct of research (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/reseval/rvx023" rel="" target="blank">https://doi.org/10.1093/reseval/rvx023</a>); (2) Bjorn Brembs’ analysis of the reliability of research published in prestige science journals (<a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/human-neuroscience/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2018.00376/full" rel="" target="blank">https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/human-neuroscience/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2018.00376/full</a>; and (3) McKiernan’s et al.’s examination of the use of the Journal Impact Factor in academic review, promotion, and tenure evaluations (<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31364991/" rel="" target="blank">https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31364991/</a>).</p>
          <p class="paragraph">&nbsp;</p>
          <p class="paragraph">&nbsp;</p>
          <p class="paragraph">Third, although the text and figures are nicely laid out, I would recommend using a smaller or different font for the figure legends to more easily distinguish them from body text.</p>

          <p class="paragraph">In "<em>Researchers Are Willing to Trade Their Results for Journal Prestige: Results from a Discrete Choice Experiment</em>", the authors investigate researchers’ publication preferences using a discrete choice experiment in a cross-sectional survey of international health and medical researchers. The study investigates publishing decisions in relation to negotiation of trade-offs amongst various factors like journal impact factor, review helpfulness, formatting requirements, and usefulness for promotion in their decisions on where to publish. The research is timely; as the authors point out, reform of research assessment is currently a very active topic. The design and methods of the study are suitable and robust. The use of focus groups and interviews in developing the attributes for study shows care in the design. The survey instrument itself is generally very well-designed, with important tests of survey fatigue, understanding (<em>dominant choice task</em>) and respondent choice consistency (repeat choice task) included. Respondent performance was good or excellent across all these checks. Analysis methods (pMMNL and latent class analysis) are well-suited to the task. Pre-registration and sharing of data and code show commitment to transparency. Limitations are generally well-described.</p>
          <p class="paragraph">&nbsp;</p>
          <p class="paragraph">In the below, I give suggestions for clarification/improvement. Except for some clarifications on limitations and one narrower point (reporting of qualitative data analysis methods), my suggestions are only that – the preprint could otherwise stand, as is, as a very robust and interesting piece of scientific work.</p>
          <p class="paragraph">&nbsp;</p>
          <p class="paragraph">1. Respondents come from a broad range of countries (63), with 47 of those countries represented by fewer than 10 respondents. Institutional cultures of evaluation can differ greatly across nations. And we can expect variability in exposure to the messages of DORA (seen, for example, in level of permeation of DORA as measured by signatories in each country, <a href="https://eur03.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Furldefense.com%2Fv3%2F__https%3A%2F%2Fsfdora.org%2Fsigners%2F).__%3B!!NVzLfOphnbDXSw!HdeyeHHei6yWQHFjhN3deSSfp82ur9i9JNOLEVOYZN0BvyslUO2S8DlvjBbautmafJEvlUsxQZbT0JLQX7lO8EcOYtZsJkA%24&amp;data=05%7C02%7Ca.l.brasil.varandas.pinto%40cwts.leidenuniv.nl%7C9f47a111adec49d04bb608dd0614ae94%7Cca2a7f76dbd74ec091086b3d524fb7c8%7C0%7C0%7C638673408085242099%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJFbXB0eU1hcGkiOnRydWUsIlYiOiIwLjAuMDAwMCIsIlAiOiJXaW4zMiIsIkFOIjoiTWFpbCIsIldUIjoyfQ%3D%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&amp;sdata=by5mhPfSM0MFFG9LE2iiYjdtSs5IhvpuukqVv%2FLak2s%3D&amp;reserved=0" rel="" target="blank" title="https://eur03.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Furldefense.com%2Fv3%2F__https%3A%2F%2Fsfdora.org%2Fsigners%2F).__%3B!!NVzLfOphnbDXSw!HdeyeHHei6yWQHFjhN3deSSfp82ur9i9JNOLEVOYZN0BvyslUO2S8DlvjBbautmafJEvlUsxQZbT0JLQX7lO8EcOYtZsJkA%24&amp;data=05%7C02%7Ca.l.brasil.varandas.pinto%40cwts.leidenuniv.nl%7C9f47a111adec49d04bb608dd0614ae94%7Cca2a7f76dbd74ec091086b3d524fb7c8%7C0%7C0%7C638673408085242099%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJFbXB0eU1hcGkiOnRydWUsIlYiOiIwLjAuMDAwMCIsIlAiOiJXaW4zMiIsIkFOIjoiTWFpbCIsIldUIjoyfQ%3D%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&amp;sdata=by5mhPfSM0MFFG9LE2iiYjdtSs5IhvpuukqVv%2FLak2s%3D&amp;reserved=0">https://sfdora.org/signers/).</a> In addition, some contexts may mandate or incentivise publication in some venues using measures including IF, but also requiring journals to be in certain databases like WoS or Scopus, or having preferred journal lists). I would suggest the authors should include in the Sampling section a rationale for taking this international approach, including any potentially confounding factors it may introduce, and then adding the latter also in the limitations.</p>
          <p class="paragraph">&nbsp;</p>

          <p class="paragraph">2. Reporting of qualitative results: In the introduction and methods, the role of the focus groups and interviews seems to have been just to inform the design of the experiment. But then, results from that qualitative work then appear as direct quotes within the discussion to contextualise or explain results. In this sense though, the qualitative results are being used as new data. Given this, I feel that the methods section should include description of the methods and tools used for qualitative data analysis (currently it does not). But in addition, to my understanding (and this may be a question of disciplinary norms – I’m not a health/medicine researcher), generally new data should not be introduced in the discussion section of a research paper. Rather the discussion is meant to interpret, analyse, and provide context for the results that have already been presented. I personally hence feel that the paper would benefit from the qualitative results being reported separately within the results section.</p>

          <p class="paragraph">&nbsp;</p>

          <p class="paragraph">3. Impact factors – Discussion section: While there is interesting new information on the relative trade-offs amongst other factors, the most emphasised finding, that impact factors still play a prominent role in publication venue decisions, is hardly surprising. More could perhaps be done to compare how the levels of importance reported here differ with previous results from other disciplines or over time (I know a like-for-like comparison is difficult but other studies have investigated these themes, e.g., <a href="https://eur03.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Furldefense.com%2Fv3%2F__https%3A%2F%2Fdoi.org%2F10.1177%2F0165551520958591__%3B!!NVzLfOphnbDXSw!HdeyeHHei6yWQHFjhN3deSSfp82ur9i9JNOLEVOYZN0BvyslUO2S8DlvjBbautmafJEvlUsxQZbT0JLQX7lO8EcOxpGR1v8%24&amp;data=05%7C02%7Ca.l.brasil.varandas.pinto%40cwts.leidenuniv.nl%7C9f47a111adec49d04bb608dd0614ae94%7Cca2a7f76dbd74ec091086b3d524fb7c8%7C0%7C0%7C638673408085255478%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJFbXB0eU1hcGkiOnRydWUsIlYiOiIwLjAuMDAwMCIsIlAiOiJXaW4zMiIsIkFOIjoiTWFpbCIsIldUIjoyfQ%3D%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&amp;sdata=w2bB5PB8l9vvCqX14MqsqEClFu2YgzGmb3MQTp3gxj8%3D&amp;reserved=0" rel="" target="blank" title="https://eur03.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Furldefense.com%2Fv3%2F__https%3A%2F%2Fdoi.org%2F10.1177%2F0165551520958591__%3B!!NVzLfOphnbDXSw!HdeyeHHei6yWQHFjhN3deSSfp82ur9i9JNOLEVOYZN0BvyslUO2S8DlvjBbautmafJEvlUsxQZbT0JLQX7lO8EcOxpGR1v8%24&amp;data=05%7C02%7Ca.l.brasil.varandas.pinto%40cwts.leidenuniv.nl%7C9f47a111adec49d04bb608dd0614ae94%7Cca2a7f76dbd74ec091086b3d524fb7c8%7C0%7C0%7C638673408085255478%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJFbXB0eU1hcGkiOnRydWUsIlYiOiIwLjAuMDAwMCIsIlAiOiJXaW4zMiIsIkFOIjoiTWFpbCIsIldUIjoyfQ%3D%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&amp;sdata=w2bB5PB8l9vvCqX14MqsqEClFu2YgzGmb3MQTp3gxj8%3D&amp;reserved=0">https://doi.org/10.1177/01655515209585</a>). In addition, beyond the question of whether impact factors are important, a more interesting question in my view is why they still persist. What are they used for and why are they still such important “driver[s] of researchers’ behaviour”? This was not the authors’ question, and they do provide some contextualisation by quoting their participants, but still I think they could do more to contextualise what is known from the literature on that to draw out the implications here. The attribute label in the methods for IF is “ranking”, but ranking according of what and for what? Not just average per-article citations in a journal over a given time frame. Rather, impact factors are used as a proxy indicators of less-tangible desirable qualities – certainly prestige (as the title of this article suggests), but also quality, trust (as reported by one quoted focus group member “I would never select a journal without an impact factor as I always publish in journals that I know and can trust that are not predatory”, p.6), journal visibility, importance to the field, or improved chances of downstream citations or uptake in news media/policy/industry etc. Picking apart the interactions of these various factors in researchers’ choices to make use of IFs (which is not in all cases bogus or unjustified) could add valuable context. I’d especially recommend engaging at least briefly with more work from Science and Technology Studies - especially Müller and de Rijcke’s excellent Thinking with Indicators study (doi: 10.1093/reseval/rvx023), but also those authors other work, as well as work from Ulrike Felt, Alex Rushforth (esp <a href="https://eur03.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Furldefense.com%2Fv3%2F__https%3A%2F%2Fdoi.org%2F10.1007%2Fs11024-015-9274-5__%3B!!NVzLfOphnbDXSw!HdeyeHHei6yWQHFjhN3deSSfp82ur9i9JNOLEVOYZN0BvyslUO2S8DlvjBbautmafJEvlUsxQZbT0JLQX7lO8EcOF3aJWtI%24&amp;data=05%7C02%7Ca.l.brasil.varandas.pinto%40cwts.leidenuniv.nl%7C9f47a111adec49d04bb608dd0614ae94%7Cca2a7f76dbd74ec091086b3d524fb7c8%7C0%7C0%7C638673408085269138%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJFbXB0eU1hcGkiOnRydWUsIlYiOiIwLjAuMDAwMCIsIlAiOiJXaW4zMiIsIkFOIjoiTWFpbCIsIldUIjoyfQ%3D%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&amp;sdata=I%2FZBIK6B0cJ0%2B2jm6DK9EiPIbyR0%2BvrivPlkfLqRPAA%3D&amp;reserved=0" rel="" target="blank" title="Original URL:

<p class="paragraph">4. Disciplinary coverage: (1) A lot of the STS work I talk about above emphasises epistemic diversity and the ways cultures of indicator use differ across disciplinary traditions. For this reason, I think it should be pointed out in the limitations that this is research in Health/Med only, with questions on generalisability to other fields. (2) Also, although the abstract and body of the article do make clear the disciplinary focus, the title does not. Hence, I believe the title should be slightly amended (e.g., “Health and Medical Researchers Are Willing to Trade …”)</p>

        Abstract: splitTextIntoParagraphs(`
        The research community’s fixation on journal prestige is harming research quality, as some researchers focus on where to publish instead of what. We examined researchers’ publication preferences using a discrete choice experiment in a cross-sectional survey of international health and medical researchers. We asked researchers to consider two hypothetical journals and decide which they would prefer. The hypothetical journals varied in their impact factor, formatting requirements, speed of peer review, helpfulness of peer review, editor’s request to cut results, and whether the paper would be useful for their next promotion. These attributes were designed using focus groups and interviews with researchers, with the aim of creating a tension between personal and societal benefit. Our survey found that researchers’ strongest preference was for the highest impact factor, and the second strongest for a moderate impact factor. The least important attribute was a preference for making changes in format and wording compared with cutting results. Some respondents were willing to cut results in exchange for a higher impact factor. Despite international efforts to reduce the importance of impact factor, it remains a driver of researchers’ behaviour. The most prestigious journals may have the most partial evidence, as researchers are willing to trade their results for prestige.

        <p class="paragraph">Peer reviewed publications are academic currency [1]. Having sufficient publications in the bank is important for hiring, promotion and funding [2, 3]. Publications are also a vital record of evidence which can improve policy and practice, and direct future research [4]. Ideally publications could be both useful as academic currency and sources of evidence for scientific progress. However, the value of publications as a currency may be trumping their main purpose to provide reliable evidence [5]. The intrinsic motivation of a “Taste for Science” (described by Merton [6]) may have been superseded by the extrinsic motivation of a “Taste for Publications” [7]. In a “publish or perish” world, researchers may “prefer popularity to intrinsic value” and hence focus on where to publish instead of what to publish [1].</p><p class="paragraph">Most researchers regularly make considered decisions on what journal to submit to and how to navigate peer review. Factors include the journal’s prestige (often defined using the impact factor), the target audience, the article processing charges, the required formatting, and the journal’s rejection rate and turnaround times. The perfect home for a paper is rare [8], and researchers often need to make compromises to be successful [9]. We aimed to study some of the important compromises that researchers make and thus examine how researchers publish their research.<br>We were especially interested in the trade-offs that researchers make concerning personal benefits and the wider benefits for society. We aimed to test trade-offs between earning academic currency and creating an accurate record of the evidence.</p><h2>Results</h2><h3>Sample description</h3><p class="paragraph">The surveys were collected between 26 March 2024 and 30 May 2024 (66 days) (see Supplement S.1). The median time to complete the survey was 7 minutes. We received 616 responses from 7,376 invites giving a response rate of 8.5%; this excludes 170 emails that were no longer active. A classification tree found that the response rate varied by email domain, with a higher response rate of 21% for – amongst others – Australia, Switzerland and the UK, and lower response rate of 3% for – amongst others – China, Germany and Japan (see Supplement S.2). The questions were generally well completed but there was some survey fatigue with under 1% missing the first choice task and 15% missing the tenth and last choice task (Supplement S.3).</p><p class="paragraph">Thirteen percent of respondents found answering the hypothetical choices to be difficult or very difficult. The dominant choice task was selected by over 99% of respondents, indicating an excellent understanding of the attributes and levels. The repeat choice task had the same answer as the original for 79% of respondents, indicating good internal consistency.</p><p class="paragraph">Summary statistics on the sample are in Table 1. Respondents had been working in research for a median of 10 years and had a median of 43 peer reviewed papers. Forty-seven percent were female.

This was both a desire for high impact factors and an aversion to papers with no impact factor. The importance of impact factor to researchers has been called an “obsession” [10], a “mania” [11], and a “game” that encourages “questionable practices” [12]. Major international initiatives have sought to combat the influence of impact factors, such as DORA in 2012<br>(https://sfdora.org/) and COARA in 2022 (https://coara.eu/). Despite these initiatives and the extensive debate on the negative consequences of using impact factors for evaluating researchers, the highest possible impact factor is a target for many researchers. A focus group participant framed impact factors as useful for “quantifying my academic abilities”, whilst a survey participant commented, “I’ve been told if it isn’t in an impact factor over 10 it doesn’t matter/count”. Journals must be indexed for three years to get an impact factor, but some respondents interpreted a journal without an impact factor as predatory rather than new, as stated by a survey participant, “I would never select a journal without an impact factor as I always publish in journals that I know and can trust that are not predatory.”</p><p class="paragraph">Researchers with more publications and more years of experience had a stronger preference for impact factor (Figure 1). This could be because some early career researchers are yet to understand the importance impact factors. Another explanation is a survivorship effect, as researchers with high impact factor publications have an advantage in employment and promotion [13], whilst researchers with less prestigious papers are out-competed [5].</p><p class="paragraph">Some survey respondents commented that they could not understand how a paper in a high impact factor journal could not be useful for their promotion or fellowship, which was a combination in the discrete choice tasks. This illustrates the power of the impact factor, as it trumps the content of the paper [11]. A recent survey showed how the content of papers is commonly neglected by grant and hiring committees, as over half use journal impact factor to assess credibility [14]. When fellowship and hiring committees make career-changing decisions based on impact factors, this sends a clear signal to researchers to prioritise impact factors over content. A researcher in our interviews appeared comfortable with being assessed based on impact factors: “People have to quantify me by something. So impact factor is a very important way to do that.” However, a focus groups participant recognised that impact factors are usually meaningless when considering real-world impacts: “I’ve been working together with senior executives in the government and federal government. They don’t care about that [journal impact factor], they only want you to give them a half-page summary.”</p><p class="paragraph">A focus group participant gave a perspective on impact factors that was pragmatic and confessional, “Considering and admitting for everybody, for various reasons, usually go for a top ranked journal in its field, and everything, and some of that will be purely mercenary, because that’s what’s required.” Personal values are ceded to the reward systems that use impact factors and/or journal ranking. We aimed to distinguish researchers with a stronger focus on system requirements by asking if they had a target number of publications per year, and 53% had a personal and/or institutional target. However, having a target did not greatly alter researchers’ preferences (Figure 1). Potentially most researchers are “playing the game” and the preference for journal ranking remains high regardless of the desired publication numbers [15].</p><p class="paragraph">A surprising result was the lack of difference in researchers’ preferences for papers that were useful for promotion by experience and publication numbers (Figure 1). This could be because the competition for funding and promotion never ends and researchers are always looking to earn academic currency. Tenured or retired professors may be under less pressure [16] and a professor from the focus groups commented, “I am the least strategic person when it comes to publishing but I think that also comes with seniority as I have no need to ever write a promotion application again!”</p><p class="paragraph">Survey participants were randomised to a scenario where their hypothetical paper had not yet been submitted to a journal or had already been desk-rejected twice (Box 1). This was raised in the focus groups, with comments including: “But then, after many rejections, right? You just want to get it out”. However, in the survey the previous rejections had no effect as researchers’ preferences were remarkably similar (Figure 1). Researchers’ preferences may be impervious to rejection, as the logical approach is to continue to pursue the highest impact factor possible. Preferences may change with more than two rejections or if the rejections were after peer review rather than desk-rejections.</p><p class="paragraph">The lowest utility was for an editor’s request of formatting changes compared with cutting a table and analysis. On average, researchers preferred not to cut their analysis, but this was less of priority than the impact factor, formatting at the submission stage, or the speed of the peer review. In the latent class analysis, the group with the strongest preference for impact factor had a surprising preference for cutting results (Figure 2), showing a willingness to compromise on their evidence to get published in prestigious journals [11]. This compromise was also discussed in our focus groups as a likely trade-off during the peer review process: “I certainly have examples where I have cut things out of papers to try and get something published.” Cutting results has also been discussed in the literature, for example: “Academics who play the ‘publish or perish’ game have a strong incentive to […] accept all ‘suggestions’ by the referees even if one knows that they are misleading or even incorrect” [17], and how during peer review “authors […] remove ideas and insights that they believe in from their work” [18]. To the best of our knowledge, our survey is the first to empirically show this compromise. An important implication is that the journals with the highest impact factors potentially have the most partial evidence, as researchers are more willing to “hold their nose” to satisfy the editors at influential journals [8]. One could argue that the journals were correct, and that the cuts improved the paper. However, in the scenario we told researchers “you believe it [your paper] is good quality” and the cut was 1,000 out of 4,000 words and included a table. Some researchers potentially rationalised this compromise by thinking that the removed results could be included in a supplement, but this relegates their findings at the “whim” of an editor [19].</p><p class="paragraph">An interesting finding from the focus groups and the survey is that researchers showed a relatively strong preference for helpful reviews and were willing to wait longer for helpful reviews. For example, an interview respondent said, “If there’s something that can improve them [my papers], I want them to be improved.” The preference for helpful reviews did not change by the researchers’ experience or number of publications (Figure 1), so it was not restricted to early career researchers. The latent group analysis showed that the second largest group most preferred a helpful review (Figure 2). The relatively strong preference for helpful reviews shows clear support for peer review, as many researchers want the expertise of their peers. Similarly, an international survey on the perception of peer review found that 93% disagree with the claim that peer review is unnecessary and 85% believe that peer review benefits scientific communication [20].</p><h3>Related studies</h3><p class="paragraph">Previous studies have examined researchers’ publication preferences using hypothetical journal choices. Similar to our results, the journal’s impact factor dominated preferences compared with the journal’s editorial board, journal’s standing among peers, quality of reviews, waiting time for reviews, and probability of being accepted [21]. Journal prestige, described using “journal level”, was also the most important attribute to junior authors in a conjoint analysis that compared journal prestige, author numbers, author order, and researchers’ time investment [22]. A choice-set survey found that researchers were willing to trade citations for a more prestigious journal [23].</p><p class="paragraph">A discrete choice experiment examined what metrics academics use when choosing papers to read [24]. There were clear preferences for citation counts, followed by the journal impact factor and download counts.</p><h3>Limitations</h3><p class="paragraph">Our discrete choice experiment was hypothetical and examined stated preferences not revealed preferences.<br>The low response rate (8.5%) reduces our ability to generalise and likely creates a non-response bias. Our approach email included words such as “journal” and “publishing” and so may have appeared similar to the many nuisance journal requests that researchers regularly receive and may have been automatically or manually deleted.</p><p class="paragraph">Respondents to our survey could be more engaged about the publication process than the wider population. We found a difference in response rate by country, hence our results over-represent some countries.</p><h2>Methods</h2><h3>Designing the discrete choice experiment</h3><p class="paragraph">We used a discrete choice experiment to examine researchers’ publication preferences as this is well-suited to testing the multiple trade-offs that researchers make when publishing papers.</p><p class="paragraph">We used multiple stages to design and deploy the discrete choice experiment (see Figure 4 and Supplement S.6 for details). With the aim of considering a wide array of attributes, we started with a literature review of papers that examined one or more potential attributes. The review collected 77 potential attributes about publications, with most concerning the journal (e.g., impact factor), the impact (e.g., social media discussion), and paper’s characteristics (e.g., paper with novel findings).</p><figure><img src="https://cms.metaror.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/12_4-1024x915.png" alt="" data-id="5945149d-074a-42a9-9311-44c9dde3c7aa"><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Figure 4: The stages of designing and deploying the discrete choice experiment to elicit researchers’ publication preferences</figcaption></figure><p class="paragraph">We used focus groups and in-depth interviews with health researchers from Australian academic institutions to explore the most important attributes, collect new attributes, and test potential trade-offs. We recruited participants from our networks and maximised for variation in career stage, gender, and research field. We ran focus groups in clinical sciences (8 participants), public health and health services research (8 participants), and used interviews for the two participants in fundamental science as we did not have enough people for a focus group. We piloted the focus group with 9 participants from health services research. The focus groups and interviews sample sizes were arbitrary, being mostly determined by the number of interested participants.</p><p class="paragraph">We used a semi-structured interview guide with an adapted nominal group technique without consensus [25]. Participants were asked to imagine they had written a paper and were now thinking of submitting it to a journal. They were asked about the attributes they consider most important when submitting to a journal. Each participant talked through up to ten attributes with the group and explained their choices. The attributes mentioned were then added to an online survey and participants voted on their most important attributes, explaining the rationale for their choices. We analysed and selected the attributes using the five steps of attribute development with a distilling approach [26].</p><p class="paragraph">An initial design of eight attributes was tested using a thinking-aloud exercise with ten researchers [27]. Researchers were shown a choice task and were asked to discuss their thoughts aloud on whether: they had any comments on the content or wording; there were any levels that they struggled to understand or that seemed unrealistic; the gaps between any levels were too jarring or obvious; and there was anything missing. This exercise identified that an attribute on journal prestige was sometimes contradictory to an attribute on journal ranking, and hence the prestige attribute was removed.</p><h3>Attribute and level selection</h3><p class="paragraph">The final attributes and levels are in Table 3. In this section we explain the choices behind the attributes and levels, and explain the perceived importance of some attributes and why some attributes were excluded.</p><p class="paragraph">Table 3: The six attributes and their levels for the discrete choice experiment. The first column is a short label used to refer to the attributes.</p><figure><img src="https://cms.metaror.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/12_t3-1024x345.png" alt="" data-id="6b137755-50e4-4ff7-a513-950a9b7dedbc"><figcaption id="6b137755-50e4-4ff7-a513-950a9b7dedbc" class="decoration"></figcaption></figure><p class="paragraph">Journal impact factor was the most common attribute in the literature review and was also frequently mentioned in the focus groups and interviews. Participants suggested that its importance relied on self-serving purposes like job promotions, grants, and funding, but also it was perceived as a reflection of the excellence of the researcher and a way to quantify the worth of their work. Related to the impact factor was the idea of predatory journals, which raised strong feelings of aversion due to reputational damage (e.g., “I avoid them like the plague”). For the levels, we decided against numeric impact factors because these numbers vary by field [28], hence we used a relative field ranking of the highest, middle, and a journal without an impact factor, which could represent a new journal or a potentially predatory journal.</p><p class="paragraph">Formatting was often considered as a “painful” process. Concerns were mentioned about the time needed to fit a journal’s style requirements, and respondents wanted to avoid onerous systems. We used two simple levels of minor and major formatting.</p><p class="paragraph">Peer review was widely discussed, with researchers interested in the speed and quality of reviews. We framed both these attributes by what their colleagues had told them, as colleagues were an important source of information about prospective journals. We used the relative labels of “slow” and “fast” rather than numeric review times (e.g., 30 days) because average times vary by field [29].</p><p class="paragraph">The focus group discussions uncovered a new issue as some researchers raised experiences of being asked by a journal editor to cut results from their paper at the peer review stage. There were multiple potential reasons including to reduce the word count, to keep a “clean story”, to make the story “digestible”, to remove results that contradicted previous findings, or to remove findings that were not of interest to journals or colleagues. We included this as an attribute as it suited the tension we were aiming to test, being a trade-off between the loss of evidence from presenting an abridged version of the work against the potential benefit of earning a publication. A difference between this attribute and the others is that it occurs post-submission.</p><p class="paragraph">The final attribute was a direct appeal to personal benefit, as it concerned whether the paper was useful or not for their next promotion or fellowship application. An example of a good quality paper that researchers might not use in a fellowship application is a “negative” study, where, for example, a new intervention or treatment did not work (often judged by the arbitrary statistical significance threshold of p &lt; 0.05). “Negative” studies can be less cited and receive less publicity than “positive” studies [30, 31], highlighting their reduced value as academic currency.</p><p class="paragraph">Article processing charges (APCs) were often discussed, but we excluded them as an attribute because they could often not be traded – for example, researchers with no budget to pay APCs. Using charges could have introduced a hypothetical bias, as researchers mostly do not personally pay the APCs and therefore the choices would be not be as meaningful [32].</p><p class="paragraph">Citations were a common attribute in the literature review, but focus group discussions revealed that these were seen as being beyond the control of the researchers and somewhat due to chance. Hence it would not be plausible to use varying citation numbers as attribute levels. Supporting this decision, a prospective study of journal editors found that citation counts were difficult to predict [33].</p><h3>Scenario</h3><p class="paragraph">The scenario in Box 1 was shown at the start of the survey and was repeated under every choice task.</p><p class="paragraph">The scenario framed the choice tasks and included some attributes of journal choice relevant for decision-making that: 1) could not be measured independently as they overlapped with other attributes, or 2) their importance was either relative across participants or deterministic. For example, the scope and readership of the journal were often mentioned in focus groups as one of the most important attributes. However, as researchers were strongly unwilling to submit to journals outside their scope, we added it to the scenario.</p><figure><figcaption id="" class=""><strong>Box 1: Scenario for the discrete choice experiment</strong><br>Imagine you have written a paper and are now trying to get it published in a journal.<br>Your paper contains original research and is around 4,000 words long with tables and figures. Your paper is relevant in your field and you believe it is good quality.<br>You will only consider journals that fit the scope of your paper and are read by your target audience. You have no previous experience with the journals (good or bad). You do not have any personal or professional relationships with the journal editors or publishers.<br>You are the first author and will make all decisions on behalf of your co-authors.<br><strong>Scenario 1 ending:</strong> Your paper has not yet been submitted to any journal.<br><strong>Scenario 2 ending:</strong> Your paper has been submitted and desk-rejected (rejected without peer reviews) by two journals.</figcaption></figure><p class="paragraph">The two scenario endings were created because in the focus groups some researchers mentioned how they might change behaviour after experiencing some rejections. To test this potential difference in the survey, researchers were randomised to view one or the other scenario ending in a 1:1 ratio.</p><p class="paragraph">Focus group participants mentioned that previous experiences with a journal, good or bad, would strongly influence their choices. To avoid this concern, the scenario stated that the researchers did not have any experience with the journal. Similarly we stated that they did not know the editorial staff, as this also influences researchers’ journal choices.</p><h3>Dominant task</h3><p class="paragraph">An example discrete choice task is shown in Figure 5. The choice tasks were unlabelled as the hypothetical journals were “A” and “B”. This example is the dominant choice task where “Journal A” is clearly the most desirable. It was used to examine whether respondents understood the task. It was shown as the first task to warm up respondents and was not used in the data analysis.</p><h3>Survey of discrete choice tasks</h3><p class="paragraph">The online survey started with a link to the participant information sheet (Supplement S.7) and asked researchers to indicate their consent. Fourteen respondents did not consent. Those who consented were shown the scenario (Box 1) and dominant task (Figure 5). Respondents next answered eight choice tasks. A final task was a repeat task of one of the eight. This was used to assess the stability of the participants’ responses based on the percentage of respondents that gave the same answer as the original task [34]. Differing answers could be due to learning effects or fatigue [34]. The repeat task was not used in the analysis.</p><p class="paragraph">The final section of the survey asked respondents if they found the choice tasks easy or difficult. We also gathered the following information from the respondents: their broad research area, gender, years of experience in research, number of published papers, country, and their perceived publication pressure. Lastly, the respondents could add optional comments. Respondents could skip any question. The complete survey is available from Supplement S.7.</p><figure><img src="https://cms.metaror.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/12_5-1024x539.png" alt="" data-id="62cb9a20-541f-4ed4-b47a-b155ac7ec676"><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Figure 5: Example discrete choice task showing the attributes and levels. This is the dominant choice task where Journal A has the levels we assumed most respondents would prefer.</figcaption></figure><p class="paragraph">The NGene (version 13.0) software was used to select 24 pairwise choice tasks based on the D-error to give an efficient fractional design. This D-efficient design was developed using the Modified Federov algorithm to estimate a multinomial logit model. For the final D-efficient design, the weights were selected from the pilot test. The 24 choice tasks were divided into three blocks of eight. Using a fractional design maximised the design’s statistical efficiency, whilst giving a manageable number of choice tasks of ten: eight plus the dominant task and re-test.</p><h2>Statistical methods</h2><p class="paragraph">We used the panel mixed multinomial logit (pMMNL) model and the panel Latent Class Model (pLCM) for the main analysis. We also used the pMMNL model to examine whether preferences systematically differed based on respondents’ characteristics. Results are presented as mean utilities with 95% confidence intervals, and the estimated attribute importance [35]. Subgroup analyses were conducted using the following characteristics: years of experience, gender, number of publications, having a publication target, and the hypothetical paper’s prior rejection. The pLCM was used to capture non-systematic heterogeneity in preferences among respondents, assuming that differences in preferences manifest as discrete groups or latent classes [36]. The ideal number of classes was determined using the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC). A pLCM was used to assess task non-attendance, incorporating a “garbage class” to identify respondents who provided non-informative responses [37]. This approach enabled an evaluation of preference heterogeneity that distinguished between attentive and non-attentive participants.</p><p class="paragraph">Our data collection and analyses were preregistered in a study protocol [38]. The only change from our planned design was that we did not use the pre-notification email for most invites, as it did not appear to increase the response rate.</p><h3>Data and code availability</h3><p class="paragraph">Our R code and data are available on GitHub [39].</p><h3>Sample size</h3><p class="paragraph">Sample size formulae are not available for discrete choice experiments and estimates are often made using rules of thumb or simulations [40, 41]. We faced uncertainty in selecting plausible model parameters, with 1 to 2 parameters per discrete choice attribute and no similar prior studies. Hence our final sample size was based on a pilot. Pilot testing has been recommended to inform sample size calculations for complex interventions [42].</p><p class="paragraph">We analysed the pilot data of 51 respondents to inform the final design. The required sample size based on minimising the D-error was 309. Both the pilot and final design had 24 choice tasks in three blocks of eight. The attributes and levels were the same in the pilot and final design, hence we combined respondents from the pilot and final surveys in our analyses.</p><h3>Sampling frame</h3><p class="paragraph">Our target population was current health and medical researchers. We approached this population by creating a sampling frame of researchers extracted from papers on the PubMed database, which is a widely used search engine that contains the MEDLINE database of published papers in life sciences and biomedical topics [43]. To capture current researchers we restricted the search from the year 2022 onwards. We used the “publication type” search field to exclude non-research papers like obituaries. We only extracted researchers who had an email available. The search was conducted on 11 April 2024.</p><p class="paragraph">The search returned over 140,000 papers, which we randomly re-ordered and iteratively extracted no more than one unique email per paper until we had a sample of 9,000 researchers. Randomly selected researchers from the sampling frame were sent an initial email with reminders one and two weeks later.</p><h2>Additional information</h2><h3>Contributions</h3><p class="paragraph">Conceptualization: NGB, SW, DB, SS, SK and AB.<br>Methodology: NGB, SS and AB.<br>Software: SS and AB.<br>Formal analysis: NGB, SS and AB.<br>Investigation: NGB, SW, DB, SS, SK and AB.<br>Data curation: AB.<br>Visualization: AB.<br>Writing—original draft: AB.<br>Writing—review and editing: NGB, SS, DB, SW, SK.<br>Funding acquisition: DB, SS, SK and AB.</p><h3>Ethics declarations</h3><p class="paragraph">The focus groups and interviews were approved by the Queensland University of Technology Human Research Ethics committee (Date: 18 April 2023, number: LR 2023-6685-13695).

Hence in the main survey we asked researchers if they had an annual publication target and what it was.</p>

    title: 'Preprint review services: Disrupting the scholarly communication landscape ',
    sections: {
        rest: `
       <h2>Introduction</h2><p class="paragraph">Preprints are well-established in some fields but not in all. Preprint servers make scientific work available rapidly (albeit usually in a form prior to peer review) and also openly, enabling scientific work to be accessed in a timely way not only by scientists but also by policymakers, journalists and others. The COVID-19 pandemic led to an unprecedented rise in the use of preprints by the biomedical research community. Preprints were an essential part of the communication of research about COVID-19, useful in particular as a way of accelerating communication of research results. Another potential benefit of preprints is that they allow authors to receive and incorporate feedback from the wider community prior to journal publication (Fraser et al., 2021). Nevertheless, due to the non-peer-reviewed nature of preprints, concerns about the lack of quality assurance remain (Blatch-Jones et al., 2023; Ni &amp; Waltman, 2023). Partly in response to these concerns, there are a growing number of services that facilitate evaluative peer feedback (e.g., comments, recommendations, reviews) on preprints. Some of these services may even be seen as alternatives to journal-based peer review, pointing towards possible future approaches to overcoming weaknesses of the journal-based peer review system.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">In Figure 1, we summarise some of the potential benefits of services facilitating the review of preprints, as they are commonly presented in sources such as the websites of preprint review services, blog posts and scientific articles. In this paper, we will explore how preprint review services are trying to achieve these benefits and how they may add value to the scholarly communication system, pointing out to a cultural shift in peer review (Avissar-Whiting et al., 2023).&nbsp;</p>
        <figure><img src="https://cms.metaror.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/14_1-1024x553.png" alt="" data-id="41dba906-f1a8-4abd-b1ff-d72ef9f0fcb2" contenteditable="false"><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Figure 1. Potential benefits of services facilitating the review of preprints. *By users, we mean scientists, policymakers, journalists, and citizens in general.</figcaption></figure><p class="paragraph">Our aim is to develop a systematic understanding of the main characteristics of preprint review services in order to evaluate how these services manage preprint review and to position these services in the wider scholarly communication and peer review environment, including journal publishing. By a preprint review service, we mean a journal-independent peer review service for articles posted on a preprint server, where the peer review process is publicly visible.&nbsp;We report here a descriptive study based on a qualitative analysis of data available in the ReimagineReview registry and other online sources, such as the websites of preprint review services, blog posts and scientific articles. This paper is complementary to a study recently reported by Lutz et al., (2023) of an ongoing survey of Alternative Publishing Platforms. By providing additional information on preprint review services, we are contributing to the work of gaining a better understanding of the landscape formed by these platforms and how they can be placed in the open scholarly communication ecosystem.&nbsp;</p>
        <p class="paragraph">We have opted not to use the term 'peer' when discussing platforms for the review of preprints, adopting instead the designation 'preprint review services', distinguishing them from 'journal-based peer review'. This better reflects the diversity of review approaches facilitated by preprint review services — from the spontaneous posting of feedback by individuals to community-driven review platforms — and considering that feedback on preprints is not bound by the conventions often associated with journal-based peer review — in fact, a variety of forms of preprint feedback are evident, ranging from minimal ‘ratings’ and informal approaches to in-depth formal peer review (Avissar-Whiting et al., 2023).</p>
        <p class="paragraph">In our work, we use as an analytical lens a framework recently proposed by some of us (Waltman et al., 2023) in which a distinction is made between four schools of thought on peer review. The four schools, referred to as the Quality &amp; Reproducibility school, the Democracy &amp; Transparency school, the Equity &amp; Inclusion school, and the Efficiency &amp; Incentives school, provide a framework for organising innovations in the peer review space, grouping them in terms of how they perceive problems of peer review and develop solutions in response to these problems. We discuss these in detail in the analysis below. We suggest that the four schools framework offers a useful way to better understand the complexity of innovation in preprint review. Based on our analysis, we reflect on possible future models of peer review and scholarly communication that may arise from the experimentation we are currently witnessing.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">Following a description of our methods in Section 2, Section 3 provides an overview of services facilitating the review of preprints. Section 4 discusses the contribution of preprint review services in addressing the various issues raised by the four schools of thought on peer review. Section 5 explores how preprint review services are managing apparent tensions between different aims, namely the ones resulting from the anonymisation of reviewers and authors. Section 6 discusses how preprint review services fit into the publishing landscape and how they may influence the development of this landscape, and Section 7 presents some concluding remarks.</p>
        <h2>Methods</h2><p class="paragraph">We carried out a descriptive study using qualitative analysis. We used ReimagineReview (RR) as a starting point to identify services and initiatives to facilitate the review of preprints. RR is a registry of services and experiments around peer review of scientific outputs created by ASAPbio (n.d.). For additional information, we supplemented the directory data with desk research using online sources such as the websites of preprint review services, blog posts and scientific articles. Using ATLAS.ti Windows (version 23.0.8.0), we carried out a qualitative analysis of text from the relevant sites, assigning codes covering what they do and why they have chosen to do it that way. Where there was ambiguity in project descriptions, we contacted the service managers to clarify and confirm some details.&nbsp;</p>
        <p class="paragraph">As of April 2022, the RR directory listed 35 services for preprint review. For our study, we considered only the services where the process of reviewing preprints was visible. ReimagineReview also includes services that do not publish reviews. We did not consider these services. We finalised the selection and analysis of services for our study in November 2022. The web sites of two preprint review services included in our initial set became unavailable after November 2022. These are the CrowdPeer and the Red Team Marked. As CrowdPeer became unavailable before we finished the analysis, we could not check and describe its main characteristics, as we did for the other services, including the Red Team Marked. Therefore, we decided not to include CrowdPeer in our final set of 23 services for review of preprints. Nevertheless, based on our initial analysis and the information available in the RR directory, we have included some comments on CrowdPeer as an illustration of possible future models of peer review and scholarly communication, where relevant. Red Team Marked was taken out of operation later and so we were able to include it in our analysis. On the other hand, some services have evolved and for these services our analyses, as a snapshot, may not be fully up-to-date. This is the case for Rapid Reviews: COVID-19, which has expanded beyond COVID-19. And so, Rapid Reviews: COVID-19 is now Rapid Reviews\Infectious Diseases, an open-access overlay journal that accelerates peer review of important infectious disease-related research preprints (RR\C19, n.d.).</p>
        <p class="paragraph">To provide an overview of the 23 services included in our final set, we first described their main characteristics according to six categories: 1) project name, 2) developed by, 3) scientific disciplines, 4) goals and intentions, 5) peer review approach, and 6) approach to transparency. Under “developed by”, we used three categories: publisher, university or individual researcher or group of researchers. When detailed information was not available online or was available but not sufficient to support our classification, we contacted the service managers, asking them to tell us how they would describe who the project is led by. We used the “other” category for those who did not answer us and where ambiguity remained.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">For the definition of scientific disciplines, we grouped all disciplines identified among our set into five categories considering the usual organisation of the scholarly communication landscape: Physical Sciences, Biomedical and Life Sciences, Engineering and Technology, Social Sciences, and Humanities. We considered the All Disciplines category for services hosting any scientific discipline or having a multidisciplinary approach without a clear definition of the disciplines or sub-disciplines included.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">To discuss how preprint review services fit into the publishing landscape and how they identify possible future models of peer review and scholarly communication, we then analysed the stated goals, review approach and transparency, using previous studies as a baseline to discuss and validate our findings, addressing the following questions:</p>
        <ul><li data-listnumber=""><p class="paragraph">How do these services differ from, and what do they have in common with traditional peer review? How are they linked with the four peer review schools of thought recently proposed by some of us (Waltman et al., 2023), and how do they manage connections between schools when adopting ideas from multiple schools?&nbsp;</p>
        </li></ul><ul><li data-listnumber=""><p class="paragraph">How can preprint review supplement journal-based peer review or offer an alternative for journal-based peer review?</p>
        </li></ul><p class="paragraph">Our use of the four schools of thought framework enabled us to explore how innovation and experimentation promoted by preprint review services can address the journal-based peer review challenges identified by Waltman et al. (2023) and provide possible solutions and future directions. We assessed the contribution of preprint review services against the key issues identified in the four schools of thought framework, considering the stated goals and intentions of each service, their approach to peer review, and their commitment to openness and transparency. As Waltman et al. (2023) state, these schools have different views on the key problems of the peer review system and the innovations needed to address these problems. While the schools may at times complement each other, the differences in their views may also give rise to tensions. Based on this idea, we aim to understand how preprint review services are able to manage possible tensions when bringing together the key issues of different schools.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">Finally, we identified possible future models of peer review and scholarly communication that may arise from the experimentation we are currently witnessing.</p>
        <ul><li data-listnumber=""><p class="paragraph">Overview of preprint review services</p>
        </li></ul><p class="paragraph">Our final set, presented in Table 1, consists of 23 services for review of preprints - some developed by newly-established groups, others by pre-existing organisations, such as publishers or universities. Some of them are focused only on reviewing preprints (7 services), others review preprints and journal articles (14) or privately shared manuscripts (5) or other types of scholarly outputs (11). The most represented category of developers is individual researcher or group of researchers (15 services), followed by others (5), publishers (2) and universities (1). The most represented scientific disciplines are all disciplines (12 services) and biomedical and life sciences (8), followed by physical sciences (3), social sciences (3), engineering and technology (2), and humanities (1).</p>

        <p class="paragraph">Table 2 lists the different approaches to peer review transparency and openness taken by the preprint review services. Offering alternative publication options or alternative approaches to quality assessment compared with the traditional journal-based model is a common goal for all services. One of the key motivations in encouraging review of preprints is to enable authors to benefit from having their work reviewed and improved before submission to a journal. This is often seen as having the potential benefit of reducing rounds of journal re-review. Some services also often give credit to reviewers as a way of incentivising participation. Review of preprints is often explicitly said to address the need for quality control of preprints, reinforcing confidence in the use of preprints and making the evaluation of scientific work more efficient and more open and transparent. Transparency is an evident priority in services that implement one or a number of different aspects of open peer review identified by Ross-Hellauer (2017) including “open reports” (where reviewer reports and author responses are published), “open identities” (where the identities of authors and reviewers are known to each other), “open interaction” (direct unmediated exchange between authors and reviewers is enabled), “open participation” (where reviewers can self-nominate and add comments without being invited to do so), amongst others. In some cases, like in Review Commons, transparency applies only to review reports and not the reviewer's identity. In others, like in SciPost and Peer Community In, reviewers have the option to withhold their identity, becoming visible only to editors or editorial staff. There are two services, Peer Community In and Hypothesis, that support double-anonymous peer review, in which not only reviewers but also authors can withhold their identity.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">The services promote new communication patterns regarding quality assessment and reviewer selection (Table 2). Public post-publication reviews, recommendations, comments, free-form commenting or quantitative scores are among the different assessment approaches we identified. When considering the seven services that are</p>
        <p class="paragraph">restricted to reviewing preprints, the most frequent quality assessment approach is the structured review form (where reviews are input using standardised structured headings). This approach is used by 4 services: PREreview, PeerRef, Review Commons and Sinai Immunology Review Project. In respect of the reviewer’s selection, apart from 2 services (Peeriodicals and Peer Community In), selection of reviewers does not depend on the editor’s decision only. We identified 7 services that allow reviewers to be selected by an editor, the editorial staff, or the community and 2 services where reviewers are selected by an automated tool. There are 12 services where reviewers can be self-nominated. Although the use of an automated tool constitutes an innovative approach to the selection of reviewers, it is not limited to preprint review services. When compared to journal-based peer review, the self-nomination of reviewers is an important innovative aspect of preprint review services, enabling reviewers to get involved in an ostensibly more participative and interactive review process. Self-nomination means that basically anyone can&nbsp;serve as a reviewer on a platform, without intervention from an editor, editorial staff or anyone else. In most cases,&nbsp;reviewers&nbsp;just have to be registered on the platform to make a comment or recommendation, or to endorse a preprint based on a pick and choose format (e.g., the Plaudit endorsement tool).</p>
        <p class="paragraph">Some initiatives offer services that&nbsp;go beyond the review process itself.&nbsp;PreLights and PREreview, for instance, invest in reviewer training for early-career researchers and in other initiatives focused on promoting and recognising reviewers.&nbsp;&nbsp;Prelights provides assessments of reviewers (peer review of peer reviews), or recognition for reviewers’ contributions. PREreview organises training workshops centred on issues of equity, diversity, and inclusion.&nbsp;&nbsp;Another focus of some services is reproducibility, a key issue relating to the quality of scientific outputs. The aim of overcoming or mitigating the lack of quality control associated with preprints and of addressing issues of reproducibility is visible in the policies and procedures of some of the services. This is the case for Queios, Scibase and Peer Community In, which request authors to make code and data openly available and then ask reviewers to consider the code and data in their review.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">Table 2: Different approaches to peer review transparency and openness</p>
        <h2>Preprint review services through the lens of four peer review schools of thought</h2><p class="paragraph">We use the four peer review schools of thought recently proposed by some of us (Waltman et al., 2023) as a framework to discuss the developments around preprint review services. Waltman et al. (2023) proposed four schools of thought on innovation in peer review, each of which has a different emphasis on what the key problems are within current peer review systems and what the priorities should be for improving these systems. Below, we present the focus of each school of thought, as previously described by Waltman et al. (2023):</p>
        <ul><li data-listnumber=""><p class="paragraph">The Democracy &amp; Transparency school focuses on making the evaluation of scientific research more democratic and transparent. Concerned that peer review systems are often elitist and opaque, this school advocates broader participation in the review process to increase the accountability of editors and peer reviewers and enable information produced in peer review to be reused by others.&nbsp;</p>
        </li><li data-listnumber=""><p class="paragraph">The Quality &amp; Reproducibility school focuses on the role of peer review in evaluating and improving the quality and reproducibility of scientific research. Based on concerns about inconsistent quality associated with peer review processes, this school is interested in innovations in peer review that improve the quality of review reports and published research. Another focal issue for this school is safeguarding research integrity and identifying scientific misconduct.</p>
        </li><li data-listnumber=""><p class="paragraph">The Equity &amp; Inclusion school focuses on making peer review processes more equitable and inclusive. This school is given impetus particularly by concerns about bias in peer review systems. It emphasises the need for a balanced representation of different groups of researchers in the peer review system to reduce or eliminate biases related to gender, geography, race, ethnicity, etc.&nbsp;</p>
        </li><li data-listnumber=""><p class="paragraph">The Efficiency &amp; Incentives school focuses on improving the efficiency of peer review processes and the incentives for peer reviewers. This school is concerned about the pressure on the peer review system, which makes it increasingly difficult to find peer reviewers, emphasising the need to increase the efficiency of peer review and to better incentivise reviewers.</p>
        </li></ul><p class="paragraph">We assessed the characteristics of the 23 preprint review services against the key issues raised by the four schools of thought, considering the stated goals and intentions of each service, their approach to peer review, and their commitment to openness and transparency. Based on those criteria, we identified how each service could be associated with each of the four schools of thought. This gives us insight into key issues, such as where the priorities of the different services lie, how they are managing apparent tensions between different aims, and to what extent they are delivering on their objectives. These designations are discussed in more detail in the following sub-sections.</p>
        <h3>Making peer review more democratic and transparent</h3><p class="paragraph">Calls for more transparent and open peer review approaches are a common feature of discussions about peer review. Recently, Kelly-Ann Allen et al. (2022) presented the lack of transparency as one of the three main challenges of peer review, together with the exploitative nature and the slowness of peer review. Based on a wide-ranging conversation on X (the social-media platform previously known as Twitter), they identified the need to open the “black box” of the current peer review system as the most constructive way to “fix peer review”. According to Fernandez-Llimos (2023) to minimise the peer review crisis, we should start recognising peer reviewers by acknowledging their contribution in every single paper they reviewed, and we can do this most effectively in open peer reviews.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">By assuming a commitment to openness and transparency, preprint review services are already arguably trying to “fix peer review”, challenging authors, reviewers, editors, and publishers to rethink and adjust their practices. Openness and transparency are common goals for all services included in our study, meaning that they all support the ideas of the Democracy &amp; Transparency school. All services in our study provide open review reports and promote open interactions among authors, reviewers and users. Still, Table 2 presents several variations in the peer review approach, selection of reviewers, management of their identities, transparency and openness. It is evident that transparency and openness have different meanings and are applied differently by different services. Managing reviewers’ identities is perhaps one of the biggest challenges the services face. As highlighted by Chloros et al., (2023) open peer review involving open identities enables better recognition of the contribution reviewers make. However, for many researchers, revealing their identity may raise concerns, like the fear of retaliation, and this may result in them providing less critical feedback. In Section 5, we discuss how preprint review services deal with this tension and how they balance transparency and openness with the interests and concerns of reviewers.</p>
        <h3>Improving quality and reproducibility</h3><p class="paragraph">The Quality &amp; Reproducibility school emphasises the crucial role of peer review in improving and certifying the quality of scientific work. A focus on quality is evident in preprint review services that train reviewers, evaluate reviewers' work, check for competing interests, and pay attention to ethics and integrity. As can be seen in Table 2, in addition to unstructured reports, preprint review services also use structured review forms, quantitative scores, and scales or ratings, showing the broad range of approaches taken by preprint review services to assess and improve the quality of scientific work. Many preprint review services have adopted ideas of the Quality &amp; Reproducibility school, thereby showing their commitment to rigorous preprint review and positioning themselves as promoters of high-quality and reproducible research. Faculty Opinions for instance states that the “caliber” of its reviewers and the “rigour” of the validation they provide ensure the quality of the research recommended by them. At Peer Community In, reviewers evaluate preprints in their thematic fields based on “rigorous peer review” and “conflicts of interests are carefully checked at each step of the process”. Plaudit considers that “publisher-independent endorsements” provided by “known and trusted academic community members provide credibility for valuable research”.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">High-quality standards in peer review are often highlighted as essential for improving research quality and reproducibility (e.g., Chambers &amp; Tzavella, 2022).&nbsp;&nbsp;As the attention given to the lack of reproducibility in research grows (e.g., Brendel, 2021; Errington et al., 2021),&nbsp;&nbsp;improving the reproducibility of research is increasingly seen as one of the responsibilities of peer review. This is reflected in the goals and intentions of some preprint review services and their policies and procedures. Examples of services for which this is the case are Scibase, Qeios and Peer Community In.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">SciBase states that “science has a reproducibility problem" and argues that “only through honest public discussion can post-publication review become part of the scientific process, meaning that the reviewer's identity is known to the public.” Reproducibility is one of the dimensions evaluated in SciBase’s review approach, which combines a report and an approval status (scale or rating). The overall rating provided by a review is a weighted average of the ratings of each of the individual dimensions, with the reproducibility dimension having the highest weight (25%). The other dimensions are logic/design, impact, transparency, clarity and versatility (15% each). SciBase also enables users to rate reviews themselves on a 1-5-star scale, with the intention of promoting transparency, rigour, accountability and reviewer recognition.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">With the aim of improving quality and reproducibility, some services, like Qeios and Peer Community In, require authors to make all study data, digital materials, and computer code publicly available at the time of submission to the maximum extent permissible by the relevant legal or ethical restrictions. Scripts, simulation code, software parameters, etc., are prerequisites for submission. Also, reviewers are asked to check that authors provide sufficient details for the methods and analysis to allow replication by other researchers, considering statistical analyses and consistency of raw data and scripts, among other critical issues. As Peer Community In states, with these prerequisites, it aims to “establish a high-quality, free, public system for identifying high-quality preprints, after rigorous peer-review.” In addition to these examples, other services like Hypothesis and Peer Library make guidelines, recommendations or other support documents available to reviewers.</p>
        <h3>Making peer review processes more equitable and inclusive</h3><p class="paragraph">Journal-based peer review is often perceived to be susceptible to disparities, inequities, and bias (e.g.,&nbsp;Bancroft et al., 2022). The need to make peer review processes more equitable and inclusive is the focus of the Equity &amp; Inclusion school. Supporters of this school often emphasise the need for a balanced representation of different groups of researchers in the peer review system to avoid biases related to gender, geography, race, ethnicity, etc.&nbsp;</p>
        <p class="paragraph">An increasing amount of attention is paid to underrepresented groups in publication and peer review processes, aiming to contribute to diversity, equity, and inclusion (Royal Society of Chemistry, n.d.). Increasing diversity amongst editors, reviewers and authors is starting to be reflected in some editorial policies and practices. A key aim is to address biases in peer review against underrepresented groups. Concerns around peer review bias highlight the complexity of social interactions among actors involved in peer review and raise questions about the nature of the various forms of bias discussed in the literature&nbsp;(Lee et al., 2013).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
        <p class="paragraph">An important example of a preprint review service explicitly addressing inequities and biases, with special attention to reviewers, is PREreview. By providing opportunities for traditionally marginalised research communities to get involved, train, connect, and be recognised for their contributions to scholarship, PREreview aims “to bring more equity and transparency to scholarly peer review.” At the same time, with the stated aim of helping researchers think deeply about how assumptions or biases may affect their assessment of manuscripts, PREreview developed the Bias Reflection Guide&nbsp;(Foster et al., 2021).&nbsp;&nbsp;This tool reflects the perspective of the Equity &amp; Inclusion school. This guide is provided to help students and researchers to make their approach to peer review more inclusive and less biased.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">PREreview enables reviewers to publish reviews with their public names (connected to ORCIDs) or pseudonyms provided by the platform. This is intended to allow reviewers to critique the work they review without fearing negative consequences, particularly if the author is more senior than the reviewer. In this way, ‘PREreviewers’, particularly those belonging to vulnerable communities, may “contribute to open preprint review without fearing retribution or judgment that may occur when their full name is attached to the feedback, whilst retaining an element of accountability”. From the point of view of reviewers, protecting their identities can be expected to reduce the likelihood of bias based on factors such as gender, ethnicity, or institutional affiliation. Arguably, it protects reviewers against retaliation and encourages rigorous and honest feedback. Preprint review services take several different approaches to handle issues related to the identity of reviewers. Even for services that invite reviewers to embrace “full transparency (i.e., critics' names and their criticisms are made publicly available)”, as Read Team Marked does, revealing one’s identity is not always mandatory (Table 2). Reviewers’ identities may be protected if they wish. Some services enable reviewers to choose whether they want to sign their review reports, others protect the identity of reviewers with a nickname or a pseudonym. Another approach is taken by Crowd preprint reviews, which aggregates the comments of different reviewers in a final synthesised review that is “publicly posted, without linking specific comments to the commenter.” Rapid Reviews: COVID-19 (RR:C19) emphasises global diversity. It works with a “global team, including board members and reviewers from all regions”, and reviewers can be anonymised upon request.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">Another approach promoted by the Equity &amp; Inclusion school is double-anonymous peer review, in which not only reviewers but also authors are anonymous. This approach is hard to implement in the context of preprint review. Nevertheless, some services make an effort to facilitate double-anonymous peer review in special situations. We will discuss this in more detail in Section 5.2.</p>
        <h3>Improving peer review efficiency and reviewer incentives</h3><p class="paragraph">Peer review is often seen as overloaded (e.g.,&nbsp;Nguyen et al., 2015; Okuzaki et al., 2019), and there is a lot of discussion about faster and more efficient approaches to peer review. Reducing inefficiencies in peer review constitutes a big challenge for journals, where the expectation typically is that a separate review process is carried out for each submission to each journal, including submissions previously rejected by other journals. By providing journal-independent portable review, preprint review services may reduce re-reviewing at multiple journals and increase the efficiency of peer review. On the other hand, depending on the extent to which journals are willing to adjust their processes and consider re-using preprint reviews, we might ask whether preprint review initiatives are, in fact, adding to an already overburdened system by creating even more work? In Section 6, we address these questions in more detail.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">With regard to portable peer review, ten years ago,&nbsp;Swoger, (2013)&nbsp;argued that rejection takes time and energy from authors, reviewers and editors, and that portable peer review reduces re-reviewing at multiple journals, increasing the efficiency of the process. Swoger pointed out the role that new "portable peer review" services, independent of specific journals, could play in cutting down on redundant work by separating the review process from the publication process.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">This illustrates one of the key issues emphasised by the Efficiency &amp; Incentives school, which focuses on improving the efficiency of peer review processes and the incentives for peer reviewers. This school is concerned about the pressure on the peer review system, in which it is increasingly difficult to find peer reviewers. Approaches to make review processes more efficient and reduce re-reviewing at multiple journals are facilitated by various preprint review services, like Rapid Reviews: COVID-19, PeerRef and Review Commons, together with initiatives to incentivise researchers by making their work more visible and recognised. Nevertheless, according to the experience reported by the Rapid Reviews: COVID-19 service, so far, there is no hard evidence that journals would want to take into account their reviews. Despite the effort made to balance rapidity and rigour and making peer review more efficient, not all journals are receptive to establishing formal relationships with preprint review services, to have access to a feed of reviews that could supplement their review process.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
        <p class="paragraph">Preprint peer review services may also address problems arising from the "reputation economy" for reviewers (Swoger, 2013). CrowdPeer, for instance, allowed reviewers “to build their reputations within the community and benefit professionally.” By implementing a reviewer evaluation system, in which the quality of a reviewer’s work is evaluated, CrowdPeer brought together key issues from the Democracy &amp; Transparency school (accountability) and the Efficiency &amp; Incentives school (recognition). Another example is preLights. By providing a “platform where early-career researchers can practise their scientific writing and reviewing skills," this service aims to raise the profiles of early-career researchers as "trusted preprint selectors and commentators." preLights provides recommendation letters to support early-career researchers.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">The attribution of a DOI (Digital Object Identifier) to public review reports makes the reviewer's work fully citable and claimable as a scientific output, and promotes recognition of reviewers. This is another way to help reviewers to gain recognition for their efforts. It is implemented by several services, like Rapid Reviews: COVID-19, Interactive Public Peer Review, and preLights. In addition, Rapid Reviews: COVID-19 and Plaudit link researchers, identified by their ORCID, to the research they have evaluated, identified by a DOI.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">For Science Open Reviewed, a “paid service [for reviewers] combined with published reviewer acknowledgement” may promote higher quality reviews, provide “fair and motivating compensation” for professional peer review services and “minimise reviewer bias and promote greater reviewer accountability.”</p>
        <h2>Managing tensions between schools of thought: Anonymisation of reviewers and authors</h2><p class="paragraph">In some cases, key priorities of different peer review schools of thought can be achieved alongside each other by the same preprint review service. For example, the Efficiency &amp; Incentives school and the Democracy &amp; Transparency school seem to complement each other in various ways. It may therefore be relatively easy for a preprint review service to embrace the ideas of both of these schools. This is, for instance, illustrated by CrowdPeer, although interestingly, this service is no longer operational. By providing “open review of preprints and engagement of a diverse group of reviewers,” it aligned with the Democracy &amp; Transparency school, making the evaluation of research more democratic and transparent. At the same time, CrowdPeer also aimed to improve the efficiency of review processes by providing “a universal structure for reviews to standardise the review process” and providing an “educational tool for reviewers.” In that way, CrowdPeer aimed to reduce the pressure on the review system, in line with the Efficiency &amp; Incentives school.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">In other cases, however, there are tensions between different peer review schools of thought, reflecting different perspectives on how peer review can best be organised. As we discuss in the next sub-sections, managing the identities of reviewers and authors is one of the biggest challenges preprint review services faces.</p>
        <h3>Anonymisation of reviewers</h3><p class="paragraph">The Equity &amp; Inclusion school promotes anonymity of reviewers, as we have seen. It sees anonymity as a way to protect reviewers against possible negative consequences of critical reviews. Especially researchers who are in an early career stage or who otherwise find themselves in a vulnerable position may fear such negative consequences. Anonymity makes it easier for these researchers to perform peer review and therefore arguably contributes to more inclusive approaches to peer review.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">The Quality &amp; Reproducibility school may also be supportive of anonymity of reviewers, based on the rationale that anonymity enables reviewers to be more frank and therefore results in higher-quality peer review. However, anonymity of reviewers is in tension with the ideas of the Democracy &amp; Transparency school. This school prefers to organise peer review as an open dialogue in which authors and reviewers participate on an equal basis, with each party accountable for their contributions. Organising peer review in this way is difficult or even impossible when reviewers are anonymous.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">As shown in Table 2, with respect to transparency and openness, preprint review services provide different options. To balance transparency and protect reviewers' interests, some services (13) enable reviewers to decide whether to sign their reviews, becoming anonymous or non-anonymous to the public. Others (8) require a non-anonymous review. In addition to the option of signing or not signing reviews, another solution already mentioned is to protect reviewers under a nickname or a pseudonym. This approach is a way in which preprint review services manage tensions between peer review schools of thought, in particular between the Democracy &amp; Transparency and the Equity &amp; Inclusion schools. PREreview is explicit that it aims to bring “more equity and transparency to scholarly peer review by supporting and empowering communities of researchers, particularly those at early stages of their career", but in doing so, it arguably also limits transparency. For Hypothesis, enabling reviewers to use a pseudonym promotes “transparency and credibility without public identity,” although it is evident that they are managing a tension between these two aims. In relation to reviewers' identity, these services attempt to balance the idea of transparency and the accountability it brings with protections for reviewers where they might experience negative consequences if their identities were disclosed.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">Anonymity of reviewers also poses a challenge for the Efficiency &amp; Incentives school. To incentivise reviewers, this school emphasises the importance of giving recognition to reviewers. However, when reviewers are anonymous, it is difficult to publicly recognise them for the efforts they make, other than to say a particular reviewer has reviewed for a particular service without any more detail than that. In particular, associating reviewers with the text of the review, and recognising their contribution at that level of detail, becomes difficult. In addition, anonymity of reviewers may also complicate the reuse of reviews, making it difficult for editors to recognise the competency and credibility of reviewers, thereby undermining the desire of the Efficiency &amp; Incentives school to make peer review more efficient.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">This highlights how complex and challenging it can be for a preprint review service to manage tensions between different priorities, like transparency, rigour, recognition, and equity and inclusion, with tensions related to anonymity in peer review being among the most challenging ones.</p>
        <h3>Anonymisation of authors</h3><p class="paragraph">For the Democracy &amp; Transparency and the Efficiency &amp; Incentives schools, performing peer review after publication, not before, offers an important way to enhance the transparency and efficiency of peer review. Hence, these schools take a critical stance towards double-anonymous approaches to peer review, in which not only reviewers but also authors are anonymous. Anonymity of authors is incompatible with the idea of performing peer review after publication. On the other hand, the Equity &amp; Inclusion school supports double anonymity, arguing that anonymity of authors reduces bias in peer review and therefore contributes to making peer review more equitable and inclusive. As already pointed out, the Quality &amp; Reproducibility school may perceive reducing bias as a way to improve the quality of peer review and may therefore also support double anonymity.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">In our set of preprint review services, there are two, Peer Community In and Hypothesis, that state they offer double-anonymous peer review (Table 2). For Peer Community In, double-anonymous peer review is not a regular practice but may happen exceptionally by request to fulfil the author's needs. To submit an article anonymously to Peer Community In, the authors must use a private web-based interface (e.g., Google Docs, Dropbox or GitHub). Data, scripts and codes must also be made available through a private web-based interface. In this way, the names of the authors do not need to be disclosed to the reviewers evaluating the article, making it possible to have a double-anonymous evaluation. If the article is eventually recommended by the recommender overseeing the peer review process, the authors must deposit a final, non-anonymised version of their article in an open archive. Although Hypothesis also claims to facilitate double-anonymous peer review, it is not clear to us how this is actually done.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">Double anonymity is essentially incompatible with preprint review. Still, although it is less transparent, it may be argued to be more inclusive because it attempts to avoid biases related to gender, geography, race, ethnicity, etc. This is clearly a compromise - an attempt to manage the tensions between the drive for transparency, characteristic of preprinting, with that of inclusiveness. By offering double-anonymous evaluation of an article, Peer Community In and Hypothesis offer a peer review process that is very similar to traditional closed journal-based peer review, making us question if one should refer to this as preprint review.</p>
        <h2>How do preprint review services fit into the publishing landscape?</h2><p class="paragraph">Preprint review services typically position themselves as complementary to journal-based peer review. The idea of being a “complementary service with no intention of competitiveness” (Peer Community In) is present in the stated aims of almost all preprint review services, which for instance, make the argument that they enable researchers to “innovate and explore new approaches to scientific dissemination, in parallel to the traditional publishing industry” (Peeriodicals). PeerRef states its aim to “provide researchers with greater choice in how their research is shared and evaluated, and eliminate the need for repeated peer review in successive journals” is a key way in which this complementarity works. Some services implement their complementary role in the system by working directly with affiliate, friendly or partner journals, including the emerging overlay journals model&nbsp;(Rousi &amp; Laakso, 2022), such as the ones hosted by Episcences, where open-peer review reports must be available on an open repository, data repository or software heritage. Other services support journals in more indirect ways, for instance by helping editors find “new research they may not have otherwise discovered” (Rapid Reviews: COVID-19) and reducing re-reviewing. In this way, preprint review services arguably help to organise peer review in more efficient ways.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">However, the success of preprint review initiatives as a complementary service to journal-based peer review depends on the extent to which journals are going to adjust their processes and are going to make use of preprint reviews. According to&nbsp;Saderi and Greaves (2021), editors may be open to these new developments only under certain conditions. To better understand if and how preprint reviews may help make journal-based peer review processes faster and more efficient, Saderi and Greaves asked editors of the journals involved in the COVID-19 Rapid Review&nbsp;(OASPA, 2020)&nbsp;initiative to fill out a short survey. Based on a small number of responses, they concluded that any progress towards an integrated workflow between preprint reviews and journal-based peer review would take a coordinated effort by different stakeholders and that this effort must focus on building mutual trust: on the one hand, the trust by editors in preprint reviews and, on the other hand, the trust by authors and reviewers that their contributions will be valued and recognised.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">If journals are not interested in making use of preprint reviews, preprint review services arguably leave themselves open to the criticism that they put even more pressure on an already overburdened system by adding another layer of review on top of journal-based peer review. Rather than developing ways to improve publishing and peer review workflows, the services might be seen as unnecessarily adding further complexity to the system. The viability of preprint review services may depend on how they address this criticism - for example by arguing that they offer alternative publication options to authors and help to turn peer review into a more rewarding experience for authors and reviewers.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">Nevertheless, while almost all preprint review services we examined ostensibly aim to supplement the current journal-based publishing system, some also identify the possibility of more radical change, aiming for more ambitious reforms of scientific publishing, considering that “the quality of published work must stand on its own, without the crutch of impact factors, journal prestige, 'likes', 'thumbs up', or the artificial stamp of approval signalled by the label “peer review”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Researchers.One), or to relieve the pressure on authors to publish their work in ’top-tier’, but often paywalled journals" (Plaudit).&nbsp;Despite some resistance from editors to partner with preprint review services, some journals are already exploring review of preprints by themselves, or partnering with preprint review services.&nbsp;This raises a key question: Should preprint review services just be seen as a complement to journal-based publishing, or could they potentially offer an alternative to journal-based publishing?</p>
        <p class="paragraph">At present, preprint review services seem to opt for a cautious approach, avoiding a radically disruptive position that could compromise their future development. However, after this first stage of experimentation, the increasing maturity of preprint review services and the involvement of and recognition from the research community may possibly enable these services to position themselves as an alternative, rather than a complement, to journal-based publishing. As discussed by Kramer et al. (2022), the dissemination function of journals may be taken over by preprint servers (although the term ‘preprint’ may no longer be appropriate), while preprint review services may take over the evaluation function of journals. In the most extreme outcome, conventional journals may cease to exist, and scientific publishing may take place entirely on preprint servers and preprint review platforms.&nbsp;</p>
        <p class="paragraph">Edmunds (2022), editor in chief at GigaScience Press, argues that as standalone movements, the several models and experiments developed to improve the journal system, “were a harder sell, but now, working together, they interact and support each other synergistically”. Like Edmunds, we believe that preprint review services offer important opportunities to improve the publishing process by improving transparency, accountability, efficiency and speed. Moreover, Edmunds highlights that “research culture has also been changing, with younger researchers seeing transparency and openness as a norm, and funders and publishers endorsing and promoting such efforts”. Edmunds is probably right that “time seems to have finally arrived” for preprinting combined with open and portable peer review.</p>
        <h2>Conclusions</h2><p class="paragraph">To provide a systematic understanding of the main characteristics of preprint review services, we carried out a descriptive study of 23 services. We described how the services have been set up to manage preprint review and how they fit into the publishing landscape. Based on this, we identified possible future models of peer review and scholarly communication.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">We used the four peer review schools of thought framework (Waltman et al., 2023) to explore how innovation and experimentation promoted by preprint review services can address the challenges of traditional journal-based peer review and provide possible solutions and future directions. Our analysis gave us insight into key issues, such as where the priorities of the different services lie and how they manage tensions between schools, reflecting different perspectives on how peer review can best be organised.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">The most important tension that we identified relates to anonymisation of reviewers and authors. In line with the ideas of the Democracy &amp; Transparency school, preprint review services promote more open forms of peer review in which authors and reviewers participate on a more equal basis. However, from the perspective of the Equity &amp; Inclusion school, this raises concerns. To make peer review processes more equitable and inclusive, this school emphasises the importance of enabling anonymisation of reviewers and possibly also authors, which is in tension with the focus on openness and transparency of preprint review services.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">Preprint review services have the potential to address a number of key issues in scholarly communication and peer review. By providing quality control, preprint review services can enrich the value of preprints, reinforce confidence in their use, and make the evaluation of research more efficient and more open and transparent. In addition, preprint review services may improve accountability and recognition of reviewers, supplement journal-based peer review, reduce the need for re-submissions, and review at multiple journals.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">The scholarly communication landscape seems to be moving toward a mixed system in which preprint servers, preprint review services and journals operate mostly in complementary ways. Preprint review services currently seem to avoid a radically disruptive position. Still, after a period of experimentation, their increasing maturity may enable these services to position themselves as an alternative, rather than a complement, to traditional journal-based publishing. In the longer term, preprint review services may, therefore, disrupt the scholarly communication landscape in a more radical way.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">Despite the potential to either complement existing scholarly communication services or even replace them, it is apparent that at present many preprint review services face problems of sustainability. During the period of our analysis, two services, CrowdPeer and Red Team Marked, were taken out of service. Whilst the reasons for their closure are not entirely clear, it is obvious that many of the services we studied are built with small budgets and have uncertain funding streams. They typically rely on the enthusiasm and commitment of volunteers. Achieving financial stability will be a challenge for many of these services, particularly if they wish to maintain the independence from large commercial interests, which many of them currently have.</p>
