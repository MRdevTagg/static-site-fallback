                    <h3>Abstract</h3>
                    <p>Background: The prestige of a journal is an important factor in the decision-making process of researchers when choosing a journal to submit their work to. However, the prestige of a journal is not only a function of the quality of the work published in it, but also of the selectivity of the journal. This selectivity is often measured by the rejection rate of the journal. In this study, we investigate the willingness of researchers to trade their research results for journal prestige, as measured by the rejection rate of the journal. Methods: We conducted a discrete choice experiment among researchers in the field of metascience. Participants were asked to choose between two hypothetical journals, each with a different rejection rate. The journals were described in terms of their rejection rate, the prestige of the journal, and the quality of the work published in the journal. Results: We found that researchers were willing to trade their research results for journal prestige. The results show that researchers were willing to submit their work to a journal with a higher rejection rate if the journal was perceived to be more prestigious. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that the prestige of a journal is an important factor in the decision-making process of researchers when choosing a journal to submit their work to. Researchers are willing to trade their research results for journal prestige, as measured by the rejection rate of the journal. This has important implications for the evaluation of research quality and the dissemination of research results.</p>
